        "HUGE place lots to do. I came for a company work event so I'm not sure what all is included in the event fee. The catering for our event was phenomenal service and food in our private area was top tier. The bull riding event was so fun the riders were entertaining and they had a dog with a little bull rider costume at the beginning and was adorable.\n\nThe general public area as mentioned earlier is non stop there is different areas one with pool tables another with claw machines and other arcade games. The hoise band stage is located in the middle with a dancefloor in front. Multiple bars located all around. Food also available. There is an outdoor smoking patio and also the restrooms are super clean for how much goot traffic comes through. Also a gift shop with any tourist memories you may need.\n\nTruly a world landmark!!",
        "Went for a concert. Go early if you are general admission because it fills up! Dress light because it also gets warm. Cocktails were hit or miss depending on what bar you went to. I liked the ones better when you first walk in. The drinks were stronger. Bathrooms definitely need care by the end of the concert.",
        "Big space but the concert area & stages are set up weird!  Pool tables are $2 a game so a bit overpriced but I guess thats everything these days!  Bull riding in back is fun to watch but a bit short as they only have u in there in segments of 4 riders..... Overall a good time! But pricey as hell other than the cheap tickets to get u in the door",
        "Sold out was insane, shaboozey was great but it was way to packed, everyone was shoulder to shoulder. A poor guy passed out near us. There was lack of security front stage and multiple fights broke out. We left early sadly. Week days are calm dance lessons are great, food is good. I hope in the future they get better air cooling for packed concerts.",
        "We went to see Charles Wesley Godwin and it was amazing. Acoustics were great. The house band did an amazing job warming up the crowd and creating a good dancing atmosphere. This was a filun night. I ate the brisket loaded tater tots and was impressed. Fun date night for sure!"

I came for a company work event so I'm not sure what all is included in the event fee. The catering for our event was phenomenal service and food in our private area was top tier. The bull riding event was so fun the riders were entertaining and they had a dog with a little bull rider costume at the beginning and was adorable.\n\nThe general public area as mentioned earlier is non stop there is different areas one with pool tables another with claw machines and other arcade games. The hoise band stage is located in the middle with a dancefloor in front. Multiple bars located all around. Food also available. There is an outdoor smoking patio and also the restrooms are super clean for how much goot traffic comes through. Also a gift shop with any tourist memories you may need.\n\nTruly a world landmark!! Went for a concert. Go early if you are general admission because it fills up! Dress light because it also gets warm. Cocktails were hit or miss depending on what bar you went to. I liked the ones better when you first walk in. The drinks were stronger. Bathrooms definitely need care by the end of the concert. Big space but the concert area & stages are set up weird!  Pool tables are $2 a game so a bit overpriced but I guess thats everything these days!  Bull riding in back is fun to watch but a bit short as they only have u in there in segments of 4 riders..... Overall a good time! But pricey as hell other than the cheap tickets to get u in the door Sold out was insane, shaboozey was great but it was way to packed, everyone was shoulder to shoulder. A poor guy passed out near us. There was lack of security front stage and multiple fights broke out. We left early sadly. Week days are calm dance lessons are great, food is good. I hope in the future they get better air cooling for packed concerts. We went to see Charles Wesley Godwin and it was amazing. Acoustics were great. The house band did an amazing job warming up the crowd and creating a good da...\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "Disappointed. $5 Miller Light Bottle. Can\u2019t figure out why these places don\u2019t take better care of the locals. Thought maybe I found my local bar. But $5 for Miller Light in a Dive Bar. I could have bought a 6 pack. I live across the street. Looking for a hangout to watch my teams. Plus TVs way way too high. Crink in the neck. Won\u2019t return. Take care of me and I\u2019ll take better care of you",
        "I did a Google search for San Antonio bars with live country music and El Honky Tonk came up.\nIt's a neighborhood bar just a little off the tourist traffic areas.\nSo glad I went - got there around 2:00 and stayed till closing time.\nPatrons were great, music was perfect AND the bartender was amazing - she was super friendly and super efficient & professional!\nI so enjoy watching a bartender work a busy bar - multi-tasking, networking, and the ability to continually smile & laugh.\nHigh recommended this watering hole ... the beer is COLD.",
        "I came after work to grab a beer, the bar was empty and I sat by myself waiting for 5 minutes while the bartender stood there on his phone. He finally came up to ask what I want to drink. Served my drink then went back on his phone. There\u2019s nba and football tonight and the tvs were turned off. The bar was empty and I didn\u2019t get welcomed. By far worst customer service, I\u2019ll stick to bar321.",

      "embedding_text": "Name: El Honky Tonk\nReviews: Disappointed. $5 Miller Light Bottle. Can\u2019t figure out why these places don\u2019t take better care of the locals. Thought maybe I found my local bar. But $5 for Miller Light in a Dive Bar. I could have bought a 6 pack. I live across the street. Looking for a hangout to watch my teams. Plus TVs way way too high. Crink in the neck. Won\u2019t return. Take care of me and I\u2019ll take better care of you I did a Google search for San Antonio bars with live country music and El Honky Tonk came up.\nIt's a neighborhood bar just a little off the tourist traffic areas.\nSo glad I went - got there around 2:00 and stayed till closing time.\nPatrons were great, music was perfect AND the bartender was amazing - she was super friendly and super efficient & professional!\nI so enjoy watching a bartender work a busy bar - multi-tasking, networking, and the ability to continually smile & laugh.\nHigh recommended this watering hole ... the beer is COLD. I came after work to grab a beer, the bar was empty and I sat by myself waiting for 5 minutes while the bartender stood there on his phone. He finally came up to ask what I want to drink. Served my drink then went back on his phone. There\u2019s nba and football tonight and the tvs were turned off. The bar was empty and I didn\u2019t get welcomed. By far worst customer service, I\u2019ll stick to bar321. Went on tues night karaoke night decent crowd friendly barstaff well worth a visit Nicole and Eden were amazing. Drinks were quick and delicious. Spurs game on, live music. Can\u2019t wait to come back\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "If youre looking for low-key hole in the wall, good service and live country music, this is the place.  Locals dancing to local musicians.  Cold beers, and good music. I was there 730p-10p on a Wed. But music started 8pm with multiple bands thru out the night.  I wanted to stay longer but had an early morning.   thoroughly enjoyed the music and the people dancing at this little gem.",
        "Visiting The White Horse in Austin was such an incredible experience and easily one of the highlights of my trip. This spot truly captures the heart and soul of Texas nightlife. From the moment I walked in, the energy was contagious \u2014 a mix of locals and visitors all coming together to enjoy a good time. The atmosphere is effortlessly cool, laid-back yet full of life, making it the perfect place to spend a night out.\n\nThe live country music is without a doubt the star of the show. The bands that play here are phenomenal, delivering authentic sounds that make you want to hit the dance floor immediately. Whether you\u2019re an experienced two-stepper or just watching from the sidelines, it\u2019s impossible not to get swept up in the rhythm and vibe of the crowd.\n\nOn top of the music, the drinks were excellent. The bartenders know how to mix strong, tasty cocktails, and the beer selection is spot on for a night of dancing and hanging out. Prices are very reasonable too, which only adds to the charm.\n\nOverall, The White Horse is more than just a bar \u2014 it\u2019s an experience. Great music, great drinks, and an atmosphere that\u2019s truly Austin. I can\u2019t wait to go back.",
        "100% fun. We were visiting Austin for the first time and so glad we went. It was a Sunday night and this joint was hopping. I can\u2019t remember the name of the house band but they were fantastic! It was quite the spectacle to see everyone two-stepping! It felt like a welcoming space\u2014everyone was friendly and there to have a good time. It ain\u2019t fancy, it was perfect!",
        "One of the first places I ever went in Austin and still get chills every time I walk in.  Hickoids and Beaumonts are the best at the white horse!  I'm from Texas she can tell by the way I'm two steppin round the room...",
        "Cute spot, the band was really good, the tacos outside are really yummy- I got the Al pastor (no onions) and veggie mushroom and potatoes.  They were a good size and tasty.  I would come back here with a group. It was nice that they had free entry before 7:30, but no re-entry after that time without paying cover charge."

Locals dancing to local musicians.  Cold beers, and good music. I was there 730p-10p on a Wed. But music started 8pm with multiple bands thru out the night.  I wanted to stay longer but had an early morning.   thoroughly enjoyed the music and the people dancing at this little gem. Visiting The White Horse in Austin was such an incredible experience and easily one of the highlights of my trip. This spot truly captures the heart and soul of Texas nightlife. From the moment I walked in, the energy was contagious \u2014 a mix of locals and visitors all coming together to enjoy a good time. The atmosphere is effortlessly cool, laid-back yet full of life, making it the perfect place to spend a night out.\n\nThe live country music is without a doubt the star of the show. The bands that play here are phenomenal, delivering authentic sounds that make you want to hit the dance floor immediately. Whether you\u2019re an experienced two-stepper or just watching from the sidelines, it\u2019s impossible not to get swept up in the rhythm and vibe of the crowd.\n\nOn top of the music, the drinks were excellent. The bartenders know how to mix strong, tasty cocktails, and the beer selection is spot on for a night of dancing and hanging out. Prices are very reasonable too, which only adds to the charm.\n\nOverall, The White Horse is more than just a bar \u2014 it\u2019s an experience. Great music, great drinks, and an atmosphere that\u2019s truly Austin. I can\u2019t wait to go back. 100% fun. We were visiting Austin for the first time and so glad we went. It was a Sunday night and this joint was hopping. I can\u2019t remember the name of the house band but they were fantastic! It was quite the spectacle to see everyone two-stepping! It felt like a welcoming space\u2014everyone was friendly and there to have a good time. It ain\u2019t fancy, it was perfect! One of the first places I ever went in Austin and still get chills every time I wa...\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "As an out-of-towner with a soft spot for dive bars, Deep Ellum seemed like the place to land. But on a Saturday night in December, the streets felt weirdly quiet. Maybe it was the cold, maybe the party packed up and split town. Hard to say. What\u2019s left feels like a jumble of big-box bars and shiny spots trying way too hard.\n\nThen there\u2019s Adair's Saloon, sticking out like a scar you\u2019re proud of. Total holdout. No gloss, no BS\u2014just grit and soul while the rest of the block sells out. Old school juke box, black marker graffiti everywhere. Tags on the walls, scribbles on the tables, names, dates, half-drunk philosophies scrawled by people who came before.\n\nCold beers that don\u2019t mess around, greasy burgers that soak up your bad decisions, and live music that couldn\u2019t care less if you\u2019re cool, rich, or Instagram-famous. Adair\u2019s feels real in a neighborhood that\u2019s mostly cosplay now. If Deep Ellum\u2019s glory days are fading, this joint\u2019s still flying the torn flag loud and proud.",
        "Adair's Saloon has been a Dallas staple for decades.  It's second incarnation is the current location at 2624 Commerce in Deep Ellum.\n\nThe humble saloon has been a live music Mecca for many listeners.  The Red-Dirt/Texas Music scene has always been strong at Adair's.  Live music nightly are rarely is there a cover charge.  A great time with good bartenders and friendly patrons.\n\nThe kitchen is always ready to provide some sustainance whether the famous Adair's Cheeseburger and Fries or one of the \"newer\" items on the menu.\n\nTake a look at the schedule and pick a night to go hear some live music.  It is a good time at Adair's Saloon.",
        "Best burger in deep ellum. Yea i said it. This is also the oldest existing bar in deep ellum, so show respect when you're here, you're in a museum of dallas culture. And in dang good company. Transport yourself to a time forgotten of big city livin' without all the \"bottleservice\" lifestyle shenanigans, tip well, put a song on the jukebox and buy a pack of cigs from the vintage cigarette machine. You are your own cowboi.",
        "My wife and I go every year for our anniversary. #7 this year. Hands down in our opinion (and a lot of others\ud83d\ude01) the finest hamburger in DFW!! The staff is always on point. Courteous, attentive,  and joyful. Simply adore Adair's!!\nBest parking, in the rear! Ifkyk.\nP.s. Special 9.99 burger and fries on Sundays!!!",
        "Delicious food and amazing burgers. I\u2019ve been twice before. I came with sister in law who is 18. They refused us service cuz she was 18 even though we didn\u2019t plan on drinking just eating. They looked like they needed the service. There wasn\u2019t a soul in there. We were excited to eat there too."

But on a Saturday night in December, the streets felt weirdly quiet. Maybe it was the cold, maybe the party packed up and split town. Hard to say. What\u2019s left feels like a jumble of big-box bars and shiny spots trying way too hard.\n\nThen there\u2019s Adair's Saloon, sticking out like a scar you\u2019re proud of. Total holdout. No gloss, no BS\u2014just grit and soul while the rest of the block sells out. Old school juke box, black marker graffiti everywhere. Tags on the walls, scribbles on the tables, names, dates, half-drunk philosophies scrawled by people who came before.\n\nCold beers that don\u2019t mess around, greasy burgers that soak up your bad decisions, and live music that couldn\u2019t care less if you\u2019re cool, rich, or Instagram-famous. Adair\u2019s feels real in a neighborhood that\u2019s mostly cosplay now. If Deep Ellum\u2019s glory days are fading, this joint\u2019s still flying the torn flag loud and proud. Adair's Saloon has been a Dallas staple for decades.  It's second incarnation is the current location at 2624 Commerce in Deep Ellum.\n\nThe humble saloon has been a live music Mecca for many listeners.  The Red-Dirt/Texas Music scene has always been strong at Adair's.  Live music nightly are rarely is there a cover charge.  A great time with good bartenders and friendly patrons.\n\nThe kitchen is always ready to provide some sustainance whether the famous Adair's Cheeseburger and Fries or one of the \"newer\" items on the menu.\n\nTake a look at the schedule and pick a night to go hear some live music.  It is a good time at Adair's Saloon. Best burger in deep ellum. Yea i said it. This is also the oldest existing bar in deep ellum, so show respect when you're here, you're in a museum of dallas culture. And in dang good company. Transport yourself to a time forgotten of big city livin' without all the \"bottleservice\" lifestyle shenanigans, tip well, put a song on the jukebox and buy a pack of cigs from the v...\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "Such an amazing non stop fun we had!!!!! Wednesday night was unexpected to end up having such a blast! We took the free dance class at 7 pm and then stayed till almost 11 pm. Everyone was extremely friendly. We danced the night away with different people who were nice to teachnus since it was our first time. Would love to come back as soon as I get s chance! You can't miss this place. I've been told Fridays and Saturdays get packed, so no much space to dance. However Wednesday night was PERFECT!! Lively enough but not packed.",
        "Had a blast at Red River in Dallas! Great live music, lots of dancing, and such a friendly, fun vibe. Perfect spot for a night out with a true country feel.",
        "First time at this place, super atmosphere, very nice crowd, loved it. Authentic, had a lot of fun, enjoyed the live music.\nNext time in town, will be back.",
        "My friends and I went on June 26, a Thursday, for a free dance lesson at 7pm and it did not disappoint. The demonstrating dancers were skilled and agile and looked like they enjoyed what they were doing. They provided a safe environment for everybody involved, even on a packed dance floor. It did get very loud and crowded around 9:30pm, but they catered the music to the attendees. 10/10 would come again.",
        "The girls are not nice. I just want to dance. Because of this I mostly people watch. It's chaos on Thursday night. Country western spot with a hiphop set. The kiosk outside has the bomb food. Get some before you leave."

      "embedding_text": "Name: Cowboys Red River | Dancehall & Saloon\nDescription: Outpost of a honky-tonk/dance hall chain with live country music, dance lessons & a mechanical bull.\nReviews: Such an amazing non stop fun we had!!!!! Wednesday night was unexpected to end up having such a blast! We took the free dance class at 7 pm and then stayed till almost 11 pm. Everyone was extremely friendly. We danced the night away with different people who were nice to teachnus since it was our first time. Would love to come back as soon as I get s chance! You can't miss this place. I've been told Fridays and Saturdays get packed, so no much space to dance. However Wednesday night was PERFECT!! Lively enough but not packed. Had a blast at Red River in Dallas! Great live music, lots of dancing, and such a friendly, fun vibe. Perfect spot for a night out with a true country feel. First time at this place, super atmosphere, very nice crowd, loved it. Authentic, had a lot of fun, enjoyed the live music.\nNext time in town, will be back. My friends and I went on June 26, a Thursday, for a free dance lesson at 7pm and it did not disappoint. The demonstrating dancers were skilled and agile and looked like they enjoyed what they were doing. They provided a safe environment for everybody involved, even on a packed dance floor. It did get very loud and crowded around 9:30pm, but they catered the music to the attendees. 10/10 would come again. The girls are not nice. I just want to dance. Because of this I mostly people watch. It's chaos on Thursday night. Country western spot with a hiphop set. The kiosk outside has the bomb food. Get some before you leave.\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "A group of colleagues and I stopped in for lunch after giving a presentation. The place was just on the corner where Uber dropped us. The food was wonderful and the decor was honky tonk tremendous! The live band took requests and nailed Purple Rain and Parsley Klein with equal excellence. We even got to see a group of kids and parents learn to line dance. I highly recommend the hot chicken sandwich with tater tots and the house Nashville Hard Cider.",
        "Lively bar at night. Not sure what it's like during the day. There several musicians that come come and play live music. They have a roof top for the warmer weather. Plenty of tables and bars inside. They get overly crowded at night. Drinks were good, but priced high. Bartenders were attentive.",
        "Honky Tonk Central is where the chaos becomes joy. The music, the madness, the balconies perfection, great views down Broadway.\n\nAnd our server Ryan? Unreal.\nThis man has Italian roots and it shows, he could teach a masterclass in hospitality. He had drinks sorted before we even realised we needed them. Friendly, funny, and actually on the ball (not that fake \u201chow\u2019s everything guys?\u201d every 3 minutes).\n\nWe came for a quick one and accidentally stayed for hours.\n\nGo to 3rd floor for the views!!\n\nIf you go: ask for Ryan.\nHe will make sure your night goes from \u201cthis is good\u201d to \u201cthis is a core memory now.\u201d",
        "When in Nashville, Honky Tonk Central is a must see.\nReasonable priced drinks and food.\nWe enjoyed an appetizer sampler and fried pickles. Price was right on for above average fried food.\nService was good and well taken care of.\nWe caught the tail end of a live band and traveled back down Broadway.",
        "The guy Muhammed at the hot dog stand was a gentleman and he helped us together food and water for a good deal!"

      "embedding_text": "Name: Honky Tonk Central\nDescription: Bustling 3-story gathering place featuring traditional pub eats & regular live country music.\nReviews: A group of colleagues and I stopped in for lunch after giving a presentation. The place was just on the corner where Uber dropped us. The food was wonderful and the decor was honky tonk tremendous! The live band took requests and nailed Purple Rain and Parsley Klein with equal excellence. We even got to see a group of kids and parents learn to line dance. I highly recommend the hot chicken sandwich with tater tots and the house Nashville Hard Cider. Lively bar at night. Not sure what it's like during the day. There several musicians that come come and play live music. They have a roof top for the warmer weather. Plenty of tables and bars inside. They get overly crowded at night. Drinks were good, but priced high. Bartenders were attentive. Honky Tonk Central is where the chaos becomes joy. The music, the madness, the balconies perfection, great views down Broadway.\n\nAnd our server Ryan? Unreal.\nThis man has Italian roots and it shows, he could teach a masterclass in hospitality. He had drinks sorted before we even realised we needed them. Friendly, funny, and actually on the ball (not that fake \u201chow\u2019s everything guys?\u201d every 3 minutes).\n\nWe came for a quick one and accidentally stayed for hours.\n\nGo to 3rd floor for the views!!\n\nIf you go: ask for Ryan.\nHe will make sure your night goes from \u201cthis is good\u201d to \u201cthis is a core memory now.\u201d When in Nashville, Honky Tonk Central is a must see.\nReasonable priced drinks and food.\nWe enjoyed an appetizer sampler and fried pickles. Price was right on for above average fried food.\nService was good and well taken care of.\nWe caught the tail end of a live band and traveled back down Broadway. The guy Muhammed at the hot dog stand was a gentleman and he helped us together food and water for a good deal!\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "NEW FAVORITE BAR ON THE STRIP!!! LOVE THIS PLACE!! They had the best bands and such a fun place to have drinks and listen to great music!! Great bucket deals on beer too.",
        "We were drawn in by the music and found it to be the PERFECT stop on Broadway! They were one of the only places playing rock (and heavy rock, at that, too). Tesla Dawn and the Butterfly Effect was on, and they were OUTSTANDING! We got a couple of drinks there which were well made, and the decor was very neat with lots of things to look at on the walls. My only complaint is the space; because it's the longest bar, the whole place is long and skinny making it crammed when listening to the band. Nevertheless, this was the best stop for music we found.",
        "I came in on a Sunday afternoon. The bartender was friendly and the band was excellent. When I walked in they were playing a Backstreet Boys cover and several people were doing the electric slide.\n\nI sat down at the bar and ordered a Red Bull and the 3 crispy beef tacos. The tacos were good, but not great, but I don\u2019t think people come here for the food. They would have been better without the addition of the avocado cream sauce, which kind of overpowered the flavor of the otherwise simple beef taco.\n\nIt was a fun spot and I would come here again!",
        "Nursing Asheville is an incredible spot\u20145 stars all the way. The energy is vibrant, the crowd is fun, and the music keeps the place alive. If you\u2019re looking for a lively night out in Asheville, this is the place to be. The drinks were great, the staff was friendly, and the overall vibe made for a memorable experience.\n\nThat said, just a heads-up: it gets really loud inside. If you\u2019re hoping for a quiet conversation, this might not be the best setting. But if you\u2019re down for dancing, socializing, and soaking up the party atmosphere, the volume just adds to the fun.\n\nAll in all, Nursing Asheville knows how to bring the good times. Definitely worth checking out if you\u2019re in town and ready for a night out with high energy and good people.",
        "We went into Nudies Honky Tonk on a week night. Very slow venue compared to others on Broadway.\nDrinks were cheaper than most but probably the worst Old Fashioned I've ever had. They do have a bottle of Louis XIII behind the bar if your wallet can take the hit.\nDefinitely could feel the history with the memorabilia on the walls and had an epic bar top with silver coins.\nThere wasn't much of anything going on so we had 1 drink and went to the next bar.\nQuick service and probably much different on a weekend for atmosphere."

      "embedding_text": "Name: Nudie's Honky Tonk\nDescription: This long-running, multi-level hangout features live music & a roadhouse vibe, plus a rooftop bar.\nReviews: NEW FAVORITE BAR ON THE STRIP!!! LOVE THIS PLACE!! They had the best bands and such a fun place to have drinks and listen to great music!! Great bucket deals on beer too. We were drawn in by the music and found it to be the PERFECT stop on Broadway! They were one of the only places playing rock (and heavy rock, at that, too). Tesla Dawn and the Butterfly Effect was on, and they were OUTSTANDING! We got a couple of drinks there which were well made, and the decor was very neat with lots of things to look at on the walls. My only complaint is the space; because it's the longest bar, the whole place is long and skinny making it crammed when listening to the band. Nevertheless, this was the best stop for music we found. I came in on a Sunday afternoon. The bartender was friendly and the band was excellent. When I walked in they were playing a Backstreet Boys cover and several people were doing the electric slide.\n\nI sat down at the bar and ordered a Red Bull and the 3 crispy beef tacos. The tacos were good, but not great, but I don\u2019t think people come here for the food. They would have been better without the addition of the avocado cream sauce, which kind of overpowered the flavor of the otherwise simple beef taco.\n\nIt was a fun spot and I would come here again! Nursing Asheville is an incredible spot\u20145 stars all the way. The energy is vibrant, the crowd is fun, and the music keeps the place alive. If you\u2019re looking for a lively night out in Asheville, this is the place to be. The drinks were great, the staff was friendly, and the overall vibe made for a memorable experience.\n\nThat said, just a heads-up: it gets really loud inside. If you\u2019re hoping for a quiet conversation, this might not be the best setting. But if you\u2019re down for dancing, socializing, and soaking up the party atmosphere, the volume just adds to the fun.\n\nAll in all, Nursing Asheville knows how to bring the good times. Definitely worth checking out if you\u2019re in town and ready for a night out with high...\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "Giving it a 3 only because of the vibe.  Granted we were there on a Monday (Broadway was still packed!) so it wasn't too crowded inside. Our waitress was great - friendly, helpful with menu items, etc.  We went up on the roof, which is a wonderful view, and the most crowded area, and then went back down to the 1st floor to eat and have drinks. The live band was good but I didn't see a lot of happy, smiling folks and the place had just generally low energy - so unlike Garth!",
        "We truly enjoyed our visit at Friends in Low Places. We went up to the Tiki Bar where there was great live music. We ordered the Chicken Tender Tower that came with fries and enough to feed the 4 of us. The fries were both traditional fries and steak fries that had the \u2018trixie\u2019 dust coating and were quite tasty. The chicken was cooked to perfection.  Overall, we loved this bar and one can definitely see the effort that Garth and Trisha put into the creation of such a great place to enjoy on Broadway.",
        "My family and I visited Friends in Low Places Bar & Honky-Tonk for lunch to celebrate my son\u2019s 21st birthday. From the moment we arrived, the host stationed outside the restaurant was exceptionally friendly and accommodating. He offered us the choice of seating in front of the band or on the second floor overlooking the stage, and we were seated promptly.\n\nShortly after, our server, Conrad, greeted us and provided outstanding service throughout the meal. He was attentive, professional, and went out of his way to make my son feel celebrated by displaying his birthday on the screen and generously providing a complimentary chocolate dessert. His thoughtful gestures truly made the experience memorable for our family.\n\nDuring our visit, I was disappointed to learn that, with only a few exceptions, many Nashville restaurants bearing the names of well-known music artists have limited direct involvement from those artists. Most are owned and operated by hospitality companies that license the artists\u2019 names, which was unexpected.\n\nWe were pleased to learn that Garth Brooks is genuinely involved in Friends in Low Places Bar & Honky-Tonk, which made the experience even more meaningful.",
        "Really, I would\u2019ve given them only 4 stars, but my server at the bar cordially and swiftly refilled my elbow-spilt cocktail, without a wince. Probably figured because I was an old guy, he\u2019d cut me a break, especially paying for another $14+dollar drink during the happy hours of the afternoon . . . on a Thursday.\n\nWe sat for almost one round and the band finally came in very hard. A good rockin\u2019 cover band with fiddle blasted away at several hits and finally played Charlie Daniel\u2019s Band, \u201cThe Devil Went Down to Georgia\u201d. About that time we were finishing our second round, and decided to start bar hoppin\u2019 since I had seen the CDB live five times.\n\nVery good sound at our position to the stage, with big flat screens everywhere. A great place to see a show. They even give souvenir plastic drink cups with the FinLP logo.\n\nThis is definitely one of the better bars we stopped in and actually hung out for a bit.\n\nDon\u2019t forget the gift store on the way out. Yikes!\n\nCritDicks",
        "We were there, form South Carolina, back in December and had a great time! Food was great, service was great\u2026but you come to Broadway for the music\u2026saw Mathew Barringer and he rocked! He is an absolute must-see when you are on Broadway! The venue is excellent for music\u2026definitely recommend!"

      "embedding_text": "Name: Friends in Low Places Bar & Honky-Tonk\nReviews: Giving it a 3 only because of the vibe.  Granted we were there on a Monday (Broadway was still packed!) so it wasn't too crowded inside. Our waitress was great - friendly, helpful with menu items, etc.  We went up on the roof, which is a wonderful view, and the most crowded area, and then went back down to the 1st floor to eat and have drinks. The live band was good but I didn't see a lot of happy, smiling folks and the place had just generally low energy - so unlike Garth! We truly enjoyed our visit at Friends in Low Places. We went up to the Tiki Bar where there was great live music. We ordered the Chicken Tender Tower that came with fries and enough to feed the 4 of us. The fries were both traditional fries and steak fries that had the \u2018trixie\u2019 dust coating and were quite tasty. The chicken was cooked to perfection.  Overall, we loved this bar and one can definitely see the effort that Garth and Trisha put into the creation of such a great place to enjoy on Broadway. My family and I visited Friends in Low Places Bar & Honky-Tonk for lunch to celebrate my son\u2019s 21st birthday. From the moment we arrived, the host stationed outside the restaurant was exceptionally friendly and accommodating. He offered us the choice of seating in front of the band or on the second floor overlooking the stage, and we were seated promptly.\n\nShortly after, our server, Conrad, greeted us and provided outstanding service throughout the meal. He was attentive, professional, and went out of his way to make my son feel celebrated by displaying his birthday on the screen and generously providing a complimentary chocolate dessert. His thoughtful gestures truly made the experience memorable for our family.\n\nDuring our visit, I was disappointed to learn that, with only a few exceptions, many Nashville restaurants bearing the names of well-known music artists have limited direct involvement from those artists. Most are owned and operated by hospitality companies that license the artists\u2019 names, ...\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "We enjoyed walking the highway and seeing the many places where live music is being played and people enjoying themselves.\n\nOne important thing to note....\nThe parking garage at 5th and Broadway turned out to be super expensive. $20. for 2 hours!\nIt might be best to park away from that area and walk in.",
        "Best Times are before 3:30 in the Afternoon. Crowds are at a minimum and Bearable. After 4 is When Traffic picks up,(especially on concert nights...so plan ahead), and the entertainment really gets to Moving. Most places are Cover Free, but I.D. check is Mandatory( so please keep it available for the rooftops. Highly recommend to Visit For at the Least...the entertainment and Experience.Dont Forget Your Boots and Hats. Check ahead for Weather updates, And Enjoy",
        "I love seeing the signs and discovering all of the different country music bars. It gets very crowded on weekend nights. The drinks are not very good so don\u2019t expect quality in that area. But, what they lack in yummy cocktails they make up for in live music and dancing! You can find more than his country music also. Those bars have rooftops and several floors in between. Try them out and see which ones you like best.",
        "I\u2019d argue you haven\u2019t truly experienced Nashville if you skip this area. It\u2019s packed with bars offering live music (of course) and plenty of great food. If you\u2019re a woman traveling solo, consider taking an Uber or Lyft back to your hotel instead of walking late at night.",
        "Honky Tonk Highway in Nashville is absolutely insane in the best way possible!\nIt is pure chaos day and night. During the day, it\u2019s nonstop live music, bachelor and bachlorette parties everywhere, and people dancing in the streets before noon. The energy is wild and contagious with every bar blasting music and serving drinks like there's no tomorrow.\n\nWhen the night comes, it turns into total madness. Neon lights, packed rooftops, bands on every floor, and mass crowds wearing hats, boots and very little clothing everywhere you look. This is the place to go to party like a Rockstar! Traffic is an absolute nightmare so plan on staying out until after 3am whether you choose to or not. Definitely something to experience!"

Best Times are before 3:30 in the Afternoon. Crowds are at a minimum and Bearable. After 4 is When Traffic picks up,(especially on concert nights...so plan ahead), and the entertainment really gets to Moving. Most places are Cover Free, but I.D. check is Mandatory( so please keep it available for the rooftops. Highly recommend to Visit For at the Least...the entertainment and Experience.Dont Forget Your Boots and Hats. Check ahead for Weather updates, And Enjoy I love seeing the signs and discovering all of the different country music bars. It gets very crowded on weekend nights. The drinks are not very good so don\u2019t expect quality in that area. But, what they lack in yummy cocktails they make up for in live music and dancing! You can find more than his country music also. Those bars have rooftops and several floors in between. Try them out and see which ones you like best. I\u2019d argue you haven\u2019t truly experienced Nashville if you skip this area. It\u2019s packed with bars offering live music (of course) and plenty of great food. If you\u2019re a woman traveling solo, consider taking an Uber or Lyft back to your hotel instead of walking late at night. Honky Tonk Highway in Nashville is absolutely insane in the best way possible!\nIt is pure chaos day and night. During the day, it\u2019s nonstop live music, bachelor and bachlorette parties everywhere, and people dancing in the streets before noon. The energy is wild and contagious with every bar blasting music and serving drinks like there's no tomorrow.\n\nWhen the night comes, it turns into total madness. Neon lights, packed rooftops, bands on every floor, and mass crowds wearing hats, boots and very little clothing everywhere you loo...\nCategory: honky tonk"

Older place with lots of character. Try the jello shots! We had 45 so they must be good! \ud83d\ude05 Definitely stop in while on Broadway. Great spot for live, eclectic music. The bartenders were attentive and kind. Love this bar! Fun place! Feels like a small town bar in the middle of it all on Broadway. Band with Dave Graham was really fun! Layla\u2019s even have their own beer, definitely recommend. We went on a Tuesday night around 7pm. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\nAmazing small and cozy bar with a great atmosphere. The live music was excellent and created a really enjoyable vibe. Drinks were well made, tasty, and reasonably priced. It\u2019s the perfect spot to relax, enjoy good music, and have a great time without spending too much. Definitely a place worth coming back to. This is the place to go if you are not a pop country fan or you\u2019re not here on a bachelorette or bachelor party. If you want good music like bluegrass and old vibes with some amazing house beer this is your spot! And they served Lonestar!!\nCategory: honky tonk"

Lively crowd, great live band, lots of seating. Can't wait to go back next year! (Outstanding people watching!!) Our favorite country western dance club in Ft Worth for my age group of girlfriends filled with all kinds of dance styles.  If you don't dance, it sure is fun to watch everyone and enjoy the music. I visited for the 1st time to see the Christmas popup and WOW, it by far exceeded my expectations! They went all out! The staff was friendly,  the cocktails were tasty and the decor was top notch. I highly recommend adding this one to your list. Ages since we have been here. Nice to have a great hotel in walking distance. #springhillsuitesfortworth 2 stepping the night away with some great live music\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29cowtown friendly is what we are all about\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "This is a great Texas Dancehall with live music, and if you\u2019ve ever seen the George Strait movie pure country, you\u2019re going to freak out because you\u2019ll be on set!  That movie was filmed here. I didn\u2019t realize it when I went in the place and I was having like this out of body experience going. I\u2019ve been here before I\u2019ve seen this place but I knew I had except I had in the movie and it looks so identical to the movie.  Fun time wonderful music.",
        "Nice place! Friendly staff!\nVery reasonably priced snack food. However be aware they deal in CASH ONLY! No debit or credit cards are taken AND they do not have an ATM on site.\nReally good Nacho's! Only $5.00 BUT my Diet Coke was flat and tasted horrible. Soda is $1.50 and water is $1.00\nI was told this is where George Strait filmed the club scenes in Pure Country.",
        "The crew does not protect the girls here. There was a group of boys harassing some girls and shouting at them and then they reported it they made the girls move. There were no repercussions for the boys at all. They didn't even acknowledge them taking photos of the girls dancing.",
        "This is an awesome place to dance! The floor is large, bands play great dancing music, and staff is friendly. Memorabilia from the movie Pure Country (scene filmed here) is plentiful and very interesting. Call ahead to reserve a table and bring your cooler with adult beverages of choice. There is a snack bar available with concession stand type food and sodas."

      "embedding_text": "Name: Western Kountry Klub\nReviews: Was a great dance venue and the people are fabulous! Live music and dancing! Really nice family place! Go to dance and enjoy yourself! This is a great Texas Dancehall with live music, and if you\u2019ve ever seen the George Strait movie pure country, you\u2019re going to freak out because you\u2019ll be on set!  That movie was filmed here. I didn\u2019t realize it when I went in the place and I was having like this out of body experience going. I\u2019ve been here before I\u2019ve seen this place but I knew I had except I had in the movie and it looks so identical to the movie.  Fun time wonderful music. Nice place! Friendly staff!\nVery reasonably priced snack food. However be aware they deal in CASH ONLY! No debit or credit cards are taken AND they do not have an ATM on site.\nReally good Nacho's! Only $5.00 BUT my Diet Coke was flat and tasted horrible. Soda is $1.50 and water is $1.00\nI was told this is where George Strait filmed the club scenes in Pure Country. The crew does not protect the girls here. There was a group of boys harassing some girls and shouting at them and then they reported it they made the girls move. There were no repercussions for the boys at all. They didn't even acknowledge them taking photos of the girls dancing. This is an awesome place to dance! The floor is large, bands play great dancing music, and staff is friendly. Memorabilia from the movie Pure Country (scene filmed here) is plentiful and very interesting. Call ahead to reserve a table and bring your cooler with adult beverages of choice. There is a snack bar available with concession stand type food and sodas.\nCategory: honky tonk"

People are incredibly nice, bartenders do an amazing job with maintaining a nice atmosphere. Free dance lessons on Friday evenings. Great bunch of folks and a good mix of younger and older crowds.",
        "Very cool placeIt didn't happen to be particularly busy.The friday night that I went, but the dance lessons were a lot of fun.And the dance floor was wide open for any time.We wanted to dance",
        "Being the only country dance hall in the area, this place has a lot of potential to grow if they wanted to.\n\nVery traditional/old style of place. When there's a DJ, he plays almost an hour straight of slow country songs that couples are dancing to. Then he'll play maybe 2 line dances or hip hop songs, then go back to the almost hour of slow country.. and repeat. Pretty boring for someone who is there by themselves to join group line dances.\n\nEven when a bunch of people get on the floor for a fun, modern line dance, he still only plays a couple of them. He should mix them evenly....a few slow country songs then a few popular line dancing songs, etc.\n\nOlder crowd (50+). No website. No cover when a DJ is playing. Half price cover before 8pm. (check their FB for info).\n\nOld bar system where the bartender keeps your card... Which wastes time when you want to close out and she has to look through a large stack of cards to find yours.\n\nFood is simple, but good. Really yummy pizzas and friendly staff.",
        "A good place to go dancing and/or listen to live Country music...Located on Hwy 78, just South of Woodbridge Rd in Sachse, Tx...(with more details on their website)...So bring your dancin' shoes, grab a partner and enjoy a night at a Texas HonkyTonk!...",
        "Cute bar. Good pool tables. It was pretty empty when my husband and I went but it was kind of nice. There were couples dancing to 90\u2019s and 2000\u2019s country which was nice to watch. Nice country bar!"

      "embedding_text": "Name: Ranch House- Sachse\nDescription: No-frills bar & grill offering burgers, sandwiches & brews, plus weekly live bands in casual digs.\nReviews: Now let\u2019s talk about the Ranch House! Y\u2019all this is the cutest little honky tonk around. People are incredibly nice, bartenders do an amazing job with maintaining a nice atmosphere. Free dance lessons on Friday evenings. Great bunch of folks and a good mix of younger and older crowds. Very cool placeIt didn't happen to be particularly busy.The friday night that I went, but the dance lessons were a lot of fun.And the dance floor was wide open for any time.We wanted to dance Being the only country dance hall in the area, this place has a lot of potential to grow if they wanted to.\n\nVery traditional/old style of place. When there's a DJ, he plays almost an hour straight of slow country songs that couples are dancing to. Then he'll play maybe 2 line dances or hip hop songs, then go back to the almost hour of slow country.. and repeat. Pretty boring for someone who is there by themselves to join group line dances.\n\nEven when a bunch of people get on the floor for a fun, modern line dance, he still only plays a couple of them. He should mix them evenly....a few slow country songs then a few popular line dancing songs, etc.\n\nOlder crowd (50+). No website. No cover when a DJ is playing. Half price cover before 8pm. (check their FB for info).\n\nOld bar system where the bartender keeps your card... Which wastes time when you want to close out and she has to look through a large stack of cards to find yours.\n\nFood is simple, but good. Really yummy pizzas and friendly staff. A good place to go dancing and/or listen to live Country music...Located on Hwy 78, just South of Woodbridge Rd in Sachse, Tx...(with more details on their website)...So bring your dancin' shoes, grab a partner and enjoy a night at a Texas HonkyTonk!... Cute bar. Good pool tables. It was pretty empty when my husband and I went but it was kind of nice. There were couples dancing to 90\u2019s and 2000\u2019s country which was nice to watch. Nice country bar!\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "This dance hall is OLD - the history here is visible in so many ways.\nNot just in the photos on the walls, but in the wooden floorboards that creek as you walk across, and the worn counter at the bar.  It is rich in atmosphere and a Texas-type of coziness.  We went for the main show on a Saturday night and it was PACKED!  Loved the place as a venue, and also for the music acts they had.  The early musicians were just as good as the main show.  I had a blast!  I wish there was more seating around the edge of the main room becuase that filled up fast!  If you're the type that likes to dance, then you've got plenty of space for that till the crowd starts pushing you forward to the stage.",
        "Visiting town it was on a Tuesday around 1pm. I wasn't expecting live music. But Sammi Rae and Henry Williams were playing. Really good too. Fun place. Bar in front then the music hall towards the back. I'm not sure if this was just going on for the holidays or if they have free live music during the day all the time. Definitely worth checking out. They have a ton of autographed pictures on the walls of many of the artists who've played there at the ticketed nightly concerts which I hear are mostly standing room only.  Lot of big names and a ton of history.",
        "Lots of memories one can imagine upon stepping through to the main area.  I can see cowboy boot wearing guys dancing with their favorite gal\u2026 happiness, sweat and a few beers.  This IS Texas history, hear the music? I do.",
        "Such a wonderful vibe. Spent a Tuesday evening on a solo trip and walked in absorbing the nostalgic old school venue. Sat on old wooden benches and listened to live music with a cold cider in my hand. Loved every second of it!",
        "Wow! I almost feel compelled to say it was an honor to visit Gruene Hall in TX! It\u2019s such a well-known venue with a rich history. My son had the privilege of performing here a few days ago. He and his band traveled from Nashville, TN, and are already looking to book it again! Playing Gruene Hall is quite an honor for a country music artist and most of them will say The Gruene is one of those infamous stages like the Grand Ole Opry that performers will have on their proverbial \u2018Bucket List\u2019 of dream stages. Watching an up and comer such as Jared Hovis play traditional country music at Gruene Hall is a sight to behold. He was honored to be there, and the tears welled up in his humble green eyes were testament to his true respect for the opportunity to sing at the Gruene!"

      "embedding_text": "Name: Gruene Hall\nDescription: Dance hall built in the 19th century hosting live country, Americana & blues musicians nightly.\nReviews: This dance hall is OLD - the history here is visible in so many ways.\nNot just in the photos on the walls, but in the wooden floorboards that creek as you walk across, and the worn counter at the bar.  It is rich in atmosphere and a Texas-type of coziness.  We went for the main show on a Saturday night and it was PACKED!  Loved the place as a venue, and also for the music acts they had.  The early musicians were just as good as the main show.  I had a blast!  I wish there was more seating around the edge of the main room becuase that filled up fast!  If you're the type that likes to dance, then you've got plenty of space for that till the crowd starts pushing you forward to the stage. Visiting town it was on a Tuesday around 1pm. I wasn't expecting live music. But Sammi Rae and Henry Williams were playing. Really good too. Fun place. Bar in front then the music hall towards the back. I'm not sure if this was just going on for the holidays or if they have free live music during the day all the time. Definitely worth checking out. They have a ton of autographed pictures on the walls of many of the artists who've played there at the ticketed nightly concerts which I hear are mostly standing room only.  Lot of big names and a ton of history. Lots of memories one can imagine upon stepping through to the main area.  I can see cowboy boot wearing guys dancing with their favorite gal\u2026 happiness, sweat and a few beers.  This IS Texas history, hear the music? I do. Such a wonderful vibe. Spent a Tuesday evening on a solo trip and walked in absorbing the nostalgic old school venue. Sat on old wooden benches and listened to live music with a cold cider in my hand. Loved every second of it! Wow! I almost feel compelled to say it was an honor to visit Gruene Hall in TX! It\u2019s such a well-known venue with a rich history. My son had the privilege of performing here a few days ago. He and his band traveled from Nashville, TN, and are already looking to book it again! Playing Gruene H...\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "Dropped on a Tuesday night as I needed a fix for some live music, but wow, what a treat.   Small venue packed with folks who love music and dancing.   I will not make the mistake of being improperly dressed again as I visit Austin.   While it\u2019s been a minute since I\u2019ve danced a proper country bar,  my southern raising made me quite jealous of those in the floor.    Great atmosphere!",
        "Old school digs for live music\nThey have one or two different bands pretty much every eve of the year, and that\u2019s pretty much what you\u2019re here for. The place is a bit loud, but not unbearably so, the people are friendly, the kusic is usually good (ion a honky-tonk kinda way), the beer is cheap and cold, and, we\u2019ll, what else do you want?",

        "finally made it here after living in Austin over 15 years.  It's quite the spot from youngsters to older Austin OG locals and one of the few places left that still feels like Austin in a way."

      "embedding_text": "Name: The Little Longhorn Saloon\nDescription: This classic honky-tonk draws crowds with cold beer, live music & famous bingo games on Sundays.\nReviews: Went to CSB, and yes, it is touristy and silly but a good excuse to grab a couple beers and listen to music in a fun place!   Crowded but line moves and you don\u2019t have to stay too long and just drop in, or stay longer if you like Dropped on a Tuesday night as I needed a fix for some live music, but wow, what a treat.   Small venue packed with folks who love music and dancing.   I will not make the mistake of being improperly dressed again as I visit Austin.   While it\u2019s been a minute since I\u2019ve danced a proper country bar,  my southern raising made me quite jealous of those in the floor.    Great atmosphere! Old school digs for live music\nThey have one or two different bands pretty much every eve of the year, and that\u2019s pretty much what you\u2019re here for. The place is a bit loud, but not unbearably so, the people are friendly, the kusic is usually good (ion a honky-tonk kinda way), the beer is cheap and cold, and, we\u2019ll, what else do you want? This place is amazing! Janet is a fantastic bartender. The music was awesome. All around a great place. Definitely make this your stop in Austin! @Destinationthisway finally made it here after living in Austin over 15 years.  It's quite the spot from youngsters to older Austin OG locals and one of the few places left that still feels like Austin in a way.\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "We stopped by on 12/23 as we'd heard good things about this dive bar and were excited it was decorated for Christmas. We got there at 6 and got one of the last open tables. They had xmas themed drinks along with your normal assortment. Not a ton of craft beer but not unexpected for a dive bar.\n\nThe drinks and shots we had were all pretty good and despite the constant line at the bar, it wasn't as hard as I expected to get drinks and we had several over the two hours we were there.\n\nI appreciated the free popcorn, decor, and live music and would like to go back when its not xmas themed.",
        "Dropped in to see the owner play on a Friday night. Old Don can still sing but damn is he out of tune on the piano! Not a big deal but it was noticeable. Place gets packed and getting a drink is ridiculous. Bartenders aren't exactly hopping. They need security to clear the pathways. People are just jammed in and standing in the way so you can't move around. But we had a great time and people were friendly!",
        "Classic Texas Honky Tonk. Real gentleman that are locals who know everyone at the bar. Musicians are world class. Fantastic entertainment! Top shelf liquor is available. Great place for lots of fun.",
        "**Donn\u2019s Depot: A Timeless Honky Tonk Gem in Austin**\n\nNestled on 5th Street in Austin, Donn\u2019s Depot is a living relic of the city\u2019s vibrant musical past, exuding an authentic honky tonk atmosphere that transports you straight to the 1980s. From the moment you step inside, the low lighting and neon signs glowing across the walls scream \u201cTexas\u201d in the most nostalgic way. This isn\u2019t a polished, modern bar\u2014it\u2019s a dive with soul, where the spirit of old Austin thrives.\n\nThe ambiance is unmatched, with weathered wooden floors and a cozy, slightly cluttered charm that feels like a friend\u2019s living room\u2014if that friend loved live music and cold beer. Speaking of beer, Donn\u2019s serves it ice-cold, the kind of frosty that hits just right on a warm Texas night. The unmistakable aroma of freshly popped popcorn wafts through the air, a simple touch that evokes memories of my first honky tonk experience here and adds to the bar\u2019s warm, welcoming vibe.\n\nLive music is the heartbeat of Donn\u2019s Depot, with local country and blues acts taking the stage most nights. The dance floor, often packed with two-steppers of all ages, is a testament to the bar\u2019s enduring appeal. The staff is friendly, the drinks are affordable, and the crowd is a mix of regulars and curious newcomers, all drawn to the unpretentious charm.\n\nDonn\u2019s isn\u2019t trying to be anything it\u2019s not\u2014with Christmas lights up all year round, it\u2019s a time capsule, a place where Austin\u2019s musical heritage lives on. For anyone craving a genuine honky tonk experience, Donn\u2019s Depot is a must-visit. Just grab a cold one, snag some popcorn, and let the neon-lit nights sweep you away.",

      "embedding_text": "Name: Donn's Depot\nDescription: Piano bar with live music, 2 dance floors & a diverse crowd, set in old rail cars & a former depot.\nReviews: We stopped by on 12/23 as we'd heard good things about this dive bar and were excited it was decorated for Christmas. We got there at 6 and got one of the last open tables. They had xmas themed drinks along with your normal assortment. Not a ton of craft beer but not unexpected for a dive bar.\n\nThe drinks and shots we had were all pretty good and despite the constant line at the bar, it wasn't as hard as I expected to get drinks and we had several over the two hours we were there.\n\nI appreciated the free popcorn, decor, and live music and would like to go back when its not xmas themed. Dropped in to see the owner play on a Friday night. Old Don can still sing but damn is he out of tune on the piano! Not a big deal but it was noticeable. Place gets packed and getting a drink is ridiculous. Bartenders aren't exactly hopping. They need security to clear the pathways. People are just jammed in and standing in the way so you can't move around. But we had a great time and people were friendly! Classic Texas Honky Tonk. Real gentleman that are locals who know everyone at the bar. Musicians are world class. Fantastic entertainment! Top shelf liquor is available. Great place for lots of fun. **Donn\u2019s Depot: A Timeless Honky Tonk Gem in Austin**\n\nNestled on 5th Street in Austin, Donn\u2019s Depot is a living relic of the city\u2019s vibrant musical past, exuding an authentic honky tonk atmosphere that transports you straight to the 1980s. From the moment you step inside, the low lighting and neon signs glowing across the walls scream \u201cTexas\u201d in the most nostalgic way. This isn\u2019t a polished, modern bar\u2014it\u2019s a dive with soul, where the spirit of old Austin thrives.\n\nThe ambiance is unmatched, with weathered wooden floors and a cozy, slightly cluttered charm that feels like a friend\u2019s living room\u2014if that friend loved live music and cold beer. Speaking of beer, Donn\u2019s serves it ice-cold, the kind of frosty that hits just right on a warm Texas night. The unmistakable aroma of freshly popped...\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "Bartenders before 7pm awesome! Weird no auto gratuity applied before 7pm\u2026 if there was we didn\u2019t notice and tipped an extra 25%. Brian was the best!! Came back in the evening for a couple more drinks after a mothership show\u2026..Bill now has auto gratuity, place was empty we were the only ones inside..\nOnly negative was the county solo guitar player.,, before 7pm\u2026we tried to tip him a $10 Canadian because that\u2019s all we had\u2026 still worth about $7 US His exact words \u201cyou can keep that\u201d as he paused in the middle of singing his song\u2026. I still dropped it in his tip bucket, because that\u2019s how we roll\u2026. He didn\u2019t deserve it though.\nWe visit Austin often, never had this expierence before\u2026we will still keep coming back.",
        "Great place for live music and dancing. They always have great local bands. There is plenty of room for dancing. I love dancing on a Saturday night, and this place never disappoints. Good prices on drinks but the typical Texas selections on beer.",
        "My boyfriend and I come to Austin every year for new years. We come back to this bar every time, specifically for Steve (bartender). He is so amazing! He recognized us even after a year. I recommend this bar!\n\nLive music, good drinks and a great vibe!",
        "Great live music, fast and friendly service.   Second option upstairs for music.",

Weird no auto gratuity applied before 7pm\u2026 if there was we didn\u2019t notice and tipped an extra 25%. Brian was the best!! Came back in the evening for a couple more drinks after a mothership show\u2026..Bill now has auto gratuity, place was empty we were the only ones inside..\nOnly negative was the county solo guitar player.,, before 7pm\u2026we tried to tip him a $10 Canadian because that\u2019s all we had\u2026 still worth about $7 US His exact words \u201cyou can keep that\u201d as he paused in the middle of singing his song\u2026. I still dropped it in his tip bucket, because that\u2019s how we roll\u2026. He didn\u2019t deserve it though.\nWe visit Austin often, never had this expierence before\u2026we will still keep coming back. Great place for live music and dancing. They always have great local bands. There is plenty of room for dancing. I love dancing on a Saturday night, and this place never disappoints. Good prices on drinks but the typical Texas selections on beer. My boyfriend and I come to Austin every year for new years. We come back to this bar every time, specifically for Steve (bartender). He is so amazing! He recognized us even after a year. I recommend this bar!\n\nLive music, good drinks and a great vibe! Great live music, fast and friendly service.   Second option upstairs for music. Downtowns best live music country bar. Always a great time chatting with staff or fellow patrons. Cheers!\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "I\u2019ve been to a number of great Texas dance halls and Honky Tonks.  Broken spoke just jumped into my top five all-time favorite!  Dance floor is nice size with a view from all of the tables. You can dance right up to the stage and it is everyone from a tourist to a real Texas two stepper.  The place literally drips with history.  Awesome experience.  I just felt like I time traveled back to the good old days.",
        "I have had several unforgettable nights here with friends! So get those boots on and let\u2019s two step under the Texas stars at Broken Spoke \u2764\ufe0f\nI love this dance hall for its chill and classy vibes. It is also open to all ages which we appreciate. The live country music can\u2019t be beat as well. Can\u2019t wait to return.",
        "I was pretty excited to come here after several failed attempts.\n$15 cover. Lots of highschool kids.\nWhy are kids here?\nIf I wanted to go to a highschool dance then I'd go back to school\nBand was okay at Best for the cover.\nVery warm beer and bartenders that couldn't even say hello.\n\nThis is the best of Austin. Skip and head downtown instead.",
        "We visited last weekend from Alabama and it was our favorite place in Austin.  The music, the dancing, and just overall vibe was amazing. Our bartender Kellie not only took great care of us there, but we ran into her a couple days later when I complimented her Broken Spoke hat then realized it was our bartender!!  Gotta love it, will be back and would recommend, ask for Kellie!",
        "Legendary venue for dancing to country & honky tonk.\nFamily friendly.\nBeer and spirit selections not too exciting, but shouldn\u2019t stop you having fun"

Broken spoke just jumped into my top five all-time favorite!  Dance floor is nice size with a view from all of the tables. You can dance right up to the stage and it is everyone from a tourist to a real Texas two stepper.  The place literally drips with history.  Awesome experience.  I just felt like I time traveled back to the good old days. I have had several unforgettable nights here with friends! So get those boots on and let\u2019s two step under the Texas stars at Broken Spoke \u2764\ufe0f\nI love this dance hall for its chill and classy vibes. It is also open to all ages which we appreciate. The live country music can\u2019t be beat as well. Can\u2019t wait to return. I was pretty excited to come here after several failed attempts.\n$15 cover. Lots of highschool kids.\nWhy are kids here?\nIf I wanted to go to a highschool dance then I'd go back to school\nBand was okay at Best for the cover.\nVery warm beer and bartenders that couldn't even say hello.\n\nThis is the best of Austin. Skip and head downtown instead. We visited last weekend from Alabama and it was our favorite place in Austin.  The music, the dancing, and just overall vibe was amazing. Our bartender Kellie not only took great care of us there, but we ran into her a couple days later when I complimented her Broken Spoke hat then realized it was our bartender!!  Gotta love it, will be back and would recommend, ask for Kellie! Legendary venue for dancing to country & honky tonk.\nFamily friendly.\nBeer and spirit selections not too exciting, but shouldn\u2019t stop you having fun\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "The Longhorn Saloon is such a cute little spot right in the heart of Fort Worth! We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon, and there was live music playing and lots of dancing. The atmosphere was lively but still relaxed\u2014exactly what you\u2019d hope for in a classic Stockyards saloon.\n\nIt\u2019s not flashy or overdone, just a fun, welcoming place with great energy. If you\u2019re exploring the area or showing friends around town, it\u2019s definitely worth popping in for the experience.\n\nOverall, a great little saloon with lots of character!",
        "We had one Hell of a time !  The Band was spot on and the crowd couldn\u2019t have been any friendlier. Cold beer and great service topped it off. Older crowd which we really enjoyed, everyone was having a Big Ball in Cowtown",
        "We had some fun and our waitress was nice but the drinks are truly horrendous. Pictured is my \u201ccrown soda\u201d next to a bottle of water lol. Again it was a fun time, I did enjoy myself but these bartenders could do a lot better for paying customers",
        "This is a great bar with an awesome Texas atmosphere but the one star is for the lady at the entrance. She is running a sham. We accidentally walked in because of the awesome bar stools they have while crossing the street. We had probably spent 30 seconds in the bar and the lady at the entrance asked another customer to reach out to us and make our way to the entrance. Without asking or giving us the option if we wanted to stay or not she made us pay for the $5 cover charge stating that if you just walk into the door after 7 pm you have to pay, even without us ordering or staying a minute at the place. Seriously, is this how you want to run a business and charge people? Have the courtesy and at least offer them a chance if they want to stay or not.\nWe ordered margaritas and it was basically just lemonade.\nI'd say terrific ambience, terrible service and people working here.\nSkip if you can.",
        "Went on Nov.22nd and opened a tab and when I closed it I asked to see the charges. She said she closed it and couldn\u2019t print out the charges. A manager RELUCTANTLY printed out the charges and was adamant that she needed that printout back. I paid and tipped in cash. The receipt said $109.55 and they took $189.55 out of my bank account. I have left a message and no return call yet. I do have a my customer receipt that shows $109.55.\nI will not return even though it was a fun place.\n\nUPDATE: thank you for the quick response. We did enjoy the establishment and hopefully when we return it will be without issue."

      "embedding_text": "Name: Lil' Red's Longhorn Saloon\nDescription: Country music & cocktails offered in a landmark spot with a dance floor & vintage rodeo memorabilia.\nReviews: The Longhorn Saloon is such a cute little spot right in the heart of Fort Worth! We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon, and there was live music playing and lots of dancing. The atmosphere was lively but still relaxed\u2014exactly what you\u2019d hope for in a classic Stockyards saloon.\n\nIt\u2019s not flashy or overdone, just a fun, welcoming place with great energy. If you\u2019re exploring the area or showing friends around town, it\u2019s definitely worth popping in for the experience.\n\nOverall, a great little saloon with lots of character! We had one Hell of a time !  The Band was spot on and the crowd couldn\u2019t have been any friendlier. Cold beer and great service topped it off. Older crowd which we really enjoyed, everyone was having a Big Ball in Cowtown We had some fun and our waitress was nice but the drinks are truly horrendous. Pictured is my \u201ccrown soda\u201d next to a bottle of water lol. Again it was a fun time, I did enjoy myself but these bartenders could do a lot better for paying customers This is a great bar with an awesome Texas atmosphere but the one star is for the lady at the entrance. She is running a sham. We accidentally walked in because of the awesome bar stools they have while crossing the street. We had probably spent 30 seconds in the bar and the lady at the entrance asked another customer to reach out to us and make our way to the entrance. Without asking or giving us the option if we wanted to stay or not she made us pay for the $5 cover charge stating that if you just walk into the door after 7 pm you have to pay, even without us ordering or staying a minute at the place. Seriously, is this how you want to run a business and charge people? Have the courtesy and at least offer them a chance if they want to stay or not.\nWe ordered margaritas and it was basically just lemonade.\nI'd say terrific ambience, terrible service and people working here.\nSkip if you can. Went on Nov.22nd and opened a tab and when I closed it I asked to see the charges. She said she closed it...\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "Super neat historical bar in the Stockyards!! The service can be a bit spotty, but it\u2019s definitely worth checking out!\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of interesting decorations and contributions from visitors. It\u2019s a simple bar with your typical bar selections, but the historical aspect of it sets it apart. The drinks are priced pretty normally. I recommend stopping in for a round and to check out the inside!",
        "White Elephant Saloon | Boots, Burgers & Bourbon-Scented Elbows \ud83e\udd20\ud83c\udf54\n\nI love the White Elephant\u2014it\u2019s like stepping into the wild, whiskey-soaked heart of Fort Worth. The vibe? Pure honky-tonk magic. The bar? Cozy\u2026 and by cozy, I mean prepare to get friendly with the person next to you, because this place is tight. And I don\u2019t mean in a bad way\u2014just... elbows will touch, and that\u2019s part of the charm.\n\nTechnically, the food comes from Love Shack next door, and y\u2019all\u2014it\u2019s a burger party in your mouth. Juicy, messy, flavor bomb central. Just know that ordering can feel a little \u201cwait\u2026 do I go over there or...?\u201d but once it lands on your table, none of that matters.\n\nDrinks? Strong, cold, and consistent. The bartenders don\u2019t play around.\n\nAll in all, White Elephant is the kind of place where you come for a drink and end up two-stepping, bonding with strangers, and contemplating naming your next pet \u201cBrisket.\u201d Highly recommend if you love a little grit with your good time.",
        "The oldest bar from From Worth. We were advised to go there by Matthew, our most friendly taxi driver in the quiet morning already",
        "Great place with some amazing history! Live music was very good and the bar staff were fantastic!",
        "I feel like the Stockyards are losing their authenticity. Brought a friend from London, the music playing was just typical rock and when the band came on at 8:00 it was very folksy, no dancing, it just didn't fit the vibe. He asked why he wasn't hearing very much country music in the whole area lol. I don't go as often as I used to when I was growing up, but I feel like the whole area is changing. But the service was good and we enjoyed our time overall."

      "embedding_text": "Name: White Elephant Saloon\nDescription: Circa-19th-century watering hole with Wild West decor, regular live music & a dance floor.\nReviews: Super neat historical bar in the Stockyards!! The service can be a bit spotty, but it\u2019s definitely worth checking out!\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of interesting decorations and contributions from visitors. It\u2019s a simple bar with your typical bar selections, but the historical aspect of it sets it apart. The drinks are priced pretty normally. I recommend stopping in for a round and to check out the inside! White Elephant Saloon | Boots, Burgers & Bourbon-Scented Elbows \ud83e\udd20\ud83c\udf54\n\nI love the White Elephant\u2014it\u2019s like stepping into the wild, whiskey-soaked heart of Fort Worth. The vibe? Pure honky-tonk magic. The bar? Cozy\u2026 and by cozy, I mean prepare to get friendly with the person next to you, because this place is tight. And I don\u2019t mean in a bad way\u2014just... elbows will touch, and that\u2019s part of the charm.\n\nTechnically, the food comes from Love Shack next door, and y\u2019all\u2014it\u2019s a burger party in your mouth. Juicy, messy, flavor bomb central. Just know that ordering can feel a little \u201cwait\u2026 do I go over there or...?\u201d but once it lands on your table, none of that matters.\n\nDrinks? Strong, cold, and consistent. The bartenders don\u2019t play around.\n\nAll in all, White Elephant is the kind of place where you come for a drink and end up two-stepping, bonding with strangers, and contemplating naming your next pet \u201cBrisket.\u201d Highly recommend if you love a little grit with your good time. The oldest bar from From Worth. We were advised to go there by Matthew, our most friendly taxi driver in the quiet morning already Great place with some amazing history! Live music was very good and the bar staff were fantastic! I feel like the Stockyards are losing their authenticity. Brought a friend from London, the music playing was just typical rock and when the band came on at 8:00 it was very folksy, no dancing, it just didn't fit the vibe. He asked why he wasn't hearing very much country music in the whole area lol. I don't go as often as I used to when I was growing up, but I feel like the whole area is cha...\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "I was there for my cousin's birthday party. I had so much fun. The live music was great.",
        "I was only there once, recently for the Texas Country Music Industry Awards, I was nominated for Photographer of the Year! It\u2019s a cool venue but I wasn\u2019t happy with the atmosphere to be honest, no one was respectful to those giving their acceptance speech on stage, everyone was drinking and being stupid and just loud and having a good old time, but had no respect for those that were there to accept their awards. It was really hard to hear them speak on the stage. I feel like the microphone could\u2019ve been a little louder, but yeah, I just wasn\u2019t happy. It was not a very professional atmosphere. It was having the awards in a bar like that to me not cool. It was much better when they had the actual awards at Billie Bob\u2019s because people were all sitting and they were listening like it was very professional award show. I wasn\u2019t happy with the atmosphere at rhinestone saloon for an award show. It\u2019s too small. It was too crowded. Too loud bad idea.",
        "Very nice place with live band every weekend. All staff is great, family friendly. It has a food truck in the back patio and the food is amazing!",
        "Friendly bartenders nice cool spot to come hang out great music to listen to.",
        "Danced in a circle that quickly turned into a country mosh pit. 10/10 recommend. Still looking for the big country black guy who danced like a white man. Bro was legit."

      "embedding_text": "Name: Rhinestone Saloon\nReviews: I was there for my cousin's birthday party. I had so much fun. The live music was great. I was only there once, recently for the Texas Country Music Industry Awards, I was nominated for Photographer of the Year! It\u2019s a cool venue but I wasn\u2019t happy with the atmosphere to be honest, no one was respectful to those giving their acceptance speech on stage, everyone was drinking and being stupid and just loud and having a good old time, but had no respect for those that were there to accept their awards. It was really hard to hear them speak on the stage. I feel like the microphone could\u2019ve been a little louder, but yeah, I just wasn\u2019t happy. It was not a very professional atmosphere. It was having the awards in a bar like that to me not cool. It was much better when they had the actual awards at Billie Bob\u2019s because people were all sitting and they were listening like it was very professional award show. I wasn\u2019t happy with the atmosphere at rhinestone saloon for an award show. It\u2019s too small. It was too crowded. Too loud bad idea. Very nice place with live band every weekend. All staff is great, family friendly. It has a food truck in the back patio and the food is amazing! Friendly bartenders nice cool spot to come hang out great music to listen to. Danced in a circle that quickly turned into a country mosh pit. 10/10 recommend. Still looking for the big country black guy who danced like a white man. Bro was legit.\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "By the time we arrived, the restaurant side was closed.\nWe sat at the bar and had a few beers (not a great/huge selection), and some cocktails.\nVery friendly and attentive bartender. She suggested two different shots and they were good!\nWe headed to the two pool tables and we kept getting a ball stuck every time. It's only a dollar (in quarters) to play. Bartender kept refunding us. Pool sticks were pretty much all bad, meaning warped or no cue tips on majority of them.\nGreat atmosphere and a fun bar.",
        "Kind of a dive bar.\nPaige the bartender pretty cool \ud83d\ude01\nHave free poker.\nAdd stand-up comedians too.\nHave some pretty good food in the back.",
        "From the bouncer to the bartender to the kitchen cook, everyone delivers 10/10 service. The drink prices are great, and the food is cooked fresh\u2014absolutely worth the wait. The vibes are amazing, and the band is exceptional.\n\nProps to Giselle, Tiffany, Curtis, and Kotcha!",
        "Listening to some good Ole Honky Tonk, eating fried oreos and enjoying a good beer.\nA very enjoyable night out.",
        "Giselle is the best bartender you'll ever meet.  Had a great time . Randy the owner is cool as well. Just be cautious having a conversation with him it will lead to him convincing you to buy a T-shirt lol nice people. I will be going back."

      "embedding_text": "Name: Honky Tonk Bar 405\nReviews: By the time we arrived, the restaurant side was closed.\nWe sat at the bar and had a few beers (not a great/huge selection), and some cocktails.\nVery friendly and attentive bartender. She suggested two different shots and they were good!\nWe headed to the two pool tables and we kept getting a ball stuck every time. It's only a dollar (in quarters) to play. Bartender kept refunding us. Pool sticks were pretty much all bad, meaning warped or no cue tips on majority of them.\nGreat atmosphere and a fun bar. Kind of a dive bar.\nPaige the bartender pretty cool \ud83d\ude01\nHave free poker.\nAdd stand-up comedians too.\nHave some pretty good food in the back. From the bouncer to the bartender to the kitchen cook, everyone delivers 10/10 service. The drink prices are great, and the food is cooked fresh\u2014absolutely worth the wait. The vibes are amazing, and the band is exceptional.\n\nProps to Giselle, Tiffany, Curtis, and Kotcha! Listening to some good Ole Honky Tonk, eating fried oreos and enjoying a good beer.\nA very enjoyable night out. Giselle is the best bartender you'll ever meet.  Had a great time . Randy the owner is cool as well. Just be cautious having a conversation with him it will lead to him convincing you to buy a T-shirt lol nice people. I will be going back.\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "This is definitely my favorite country bar. The venue is very nice and spacious with lots of seating downstairs and upstairs. The dance floor is huge. I loved the stools along the dance floor for watching the dancers. Great mix of music with lots of line dancing throughout. There's also billiards and a smoking room. I'll return next time I'm in OKC.",
        "I walked in at the tail end of a line dance class so learned it. Have never seen a class offered so late. I guess too much going on in OK City for a crowd there so didn't get to dance except for a line dance. Nice dance floor, friendly staff, good bartenders and DJ. Lots of room to move about and do different things.",
        "Amazing venue, it has a ton of potential. Great bartenders and security. Terrible DJ and culture. DJ couldn\u2019t pick a BPM range, genre nor the correct tempo to a song. At points he\u2019d mix songs every 30 seconds. Even overheard the security guards complaining about it. Awesome place for two stepping and swing, don\u2019t get me wrong, but line dancing seemed to have only been 2 songs every hour on a Friday night. You could tell the line dancing tourist from out of town were upset and left early in the night.\n\nNothing against the instructors, amazing people when I talked to them. The lessons took way too long to teach, after two hours we were already ready to leave. As a tip for the two step instructor, try to learn common moves and terms to explain what you\u2019re doing. Not do \u201cthis\u201d or do \u201cthat\u201d",
        "Went here for the 1st time the other night with some girl friends for a birthday party. The cover was free before 10pm, parking was 10. Drinks were about 8-9. The line dancing happened pretty quick so I kept missing my chance to get out there every time. The atmosphere felt safe and everyone got along inside. Would like to go back again sometime! I like the bi-level bar idea and lots of seating! Security was nice! Lots of cops around outside tho so if u don't like that idea stay away! And all over at closing time downtown.",
        "Great bar and dance hall. They do live music and special events sometimes too and it\u2019s always a blast. Great atmosphere and bartenders. Security is great and run a good system. The owner was really nice as well she was great! Highly recommend"

      "embedding_text": "Name: Oklahoma Ranch\nReviews: This is definitely my favorite country bar. The venue is very nice and spacious with lots of seating downstairs and upstairs. The dance floor is huge. I loved the stools along the dance floor for watching the dancers. Great mix of music with lots of line dancing throughout. There's also billiards and a smoking room. I'll return next time I'm in OKC. I walked in at the tail end of a line dance class so learned it. Have never seen a class offered so late. I guess too much going on in OK City for a crowd there so didn't get to dance except for a line dance. Nice dance floor, friendly staff, good bartenders and DJ. Lots of room to move about and do different things. Amazing venue, it has a ton of potential. Great bartenders and security. Terrible DJ and culture. DJ couldn\u2019t pick a BPM range, genre nor the correct tempo to a song. At points he\u2019d mix songs every 30 seconds. Even overheard the security guards complaining about it. Awesome place for two stepping and swing, don\u2019t get me wrong, but line dancing seemed to have only been 2 songs every hour on a Friday night. You could tell the line dancing tourist from out of town were upset and left early in the night.\n\nNothing against the instructors, amazing people when I talked to them. The lessons took way too long to teach, after two hours we were already ready to leave. As a tip for the two step instructor, try to learn common moves and terms to explain what you\u2019re doing. Not do \u201cthis\u201d or do \u201cthat\u201d Went here for the 1st time the other night with some girl friends for a birthday party. The cover was free before 10pm, parking was 10. Drinks were about 8-9. The line dancing happened pretty quick so I kept missing my chance to get out there every time. The atmosphere felt safe and everyone got along inside. Would like to go back again sometime! I like the bi-level bar idea and lots of seating! Security was nice! Lots of cops around outside tho so if u don't like that idea stay away! And all over at closing time downtown. Gre...\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "I visited Cowboys OKC and had a great time. The rodeo and bull riding were exciting and felt very authentic. There was also plenty of dancing, a great vibe, and a fun western atmosphere. The crowd was friendly and welcoming, and the overall mood was positive and energetic. A perfect place to enjoy rodeo, dancing, and true cowboy culture in Oklahoma City",
        "I went on one of the nights that the riders were not gonna be on the Bulls so we didn\u2019t go in but from what we heard it was a wonderful place.  We did go there and see the place which it was nice and very Ranchy with fun sounds coming from the inside. I just won\u2019t pay cover to get into a club so if the main attraction is not there I don\u2019t want to pay. We actually asked some locals where to go after Goo Goo Dolls and they said to go to Cowboys OKC. I wish the riders were there but I will try again when I am back.",
        "Great place to dance. Doors open at 8 pm, get there early or you may not get a table. Packed by 9:30, they have a mechanical bull, and ride live bulls between 10:30-11:00 pm on Fri & Sat night.",
        "We had a great time I definitely think if you are in the area to check this place out.",
        "\ud83e\udd20 \ud83d\udc34 \ud83d\udc02 Cowboys is the only place I go out, and I\u2019ve been coming here since my college days in 2009. Yes, on Friday nights there can be \u2018less\u2019 country 2 stepping but it\u2019s still a solid 1/3 of the songs. Thursday and Saturday are typically more country and Friday can have hip hop mixed in too for the younger crowd- in my experience over 16 years.\n\nFriday and Saturdays LIVE bull riding is always amazing and my favorite, as an equestrian and farm woman myself.\n\nThe Mechanical Bull here IS WAY BETTER THAN REDNECKS.\n\nAs an actual rider, this bull is a 40,000$+++++ professional training mechanical bull that REAL bull riders train on.\n\nRednecks\u2019s is weird and doesn\u2019t even do the proper motion at all.\n\n\u201cTraining\u201d on the mechanical bull here and watching the riders is my favorite- but I also love the entire staff and the perfect blend of 2 stepping, line dances, and some classic 90s hip hop on Fridays.\n\nThe bar tenders are all kind and excellent at their job, the bouncers are great and the management is great. They do an amazing job at catering to all generations and I always go alone, and make friends and dance with strangers every time.\n\nIt\u2019s the most inclusive club to go to solo or with a group or for date night. Upstairs is chill, with pool tables everywhere. A TON of bathrooms both upstairs, and downstairs. You\u2019ll never have to wait in a line or have no toilet paper.\n\nBar tenders prepare multiple water cups and leave them out on the bar to grab and the water IS FILTERED \ud83d\udca5 not tap.\n\n11/10 this is the spot to spend your weekends."

      "embedding_text": "Name: COWBOYS OKC\nDescription: Down-home dance club showcasing live country music, along with indoor bull riding on weekends.\nReviews: I visited Cowboys OKC and had a great time. The rodeo and bull riding were exciting and felt very authentic. There was also plenty of dancing, a great vibe, and a fun western atmosphere. The crowd was friendly and welcoming, and the overall mood was positive and energetic. A perfect place to enjoy rodeo, dancing, and true cowboy culture in Oklahoma City I went on one of the nights that the riders were not gonna be on the Bulls so we didn\u2019t go in but from what we heard it was a wonderful place.  We did go there and see the place which it was nice and very Ranchy with fun sounds coming from the inside. I just won\u2019t pay cover to get into a club so if the main attraction is not there I don\u2019t want to pay. We actually asked some locals where to go after Goo Goo Dolls and they said to go to Cowboys OKC. I wish the riders were there but I will try again when I am back. Great place to dance. Doors open at 8 pm, get there early or you may not get a table. Packed by 9:30, they have a mechanical bull, and ride live bulls between 10:30-11:00 pm on Fri & Sat night. We had a great time I definitely think if you are in the area to check this place out. \ud83e\udd20 \ud83d\udc34 \ud83d\udc02 Cowboys is the only place I go out, and I\u2019ve been coming here since my college days in 2009. Yes, on Friday nights there can be \u2018less\u2019 country 2 stepping but it\u2019s still a solid 1/3 of the songs. Thursday and Saturday are typically more country and Friday can have hip hop mixed in too for the younger crowd- in my experience over 16 years.\n\nFriday and Saturdays LIVE bull riding is always amazing and my favorite, as an equestrian and farm woman myself.\n\nThe Mechanical Bull here IS WAY BETTER THAN REDNECKS.\n\nAs an actual rider, this bull is a 40,000$+++++ professional training mechanical bull that REAL bull riders train on.\n\nRednecks\u2019s is weird and doesn\u2019t even do the proper motion at all.\n\n\u201cTraining\u201d on the mechanical bull here and watching the riders is my favorite- but I also love the entire staff and the perfect blend of 2 step...\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "I wasn't able to experience the food here, but I would like to applaud how well received the Cowboys vs Aliens event with Tilt The Dirt was. Staff was pretty flexible, and the place was packed out for such a change of place/setting for this type of music. Every DJ did their part and brought their A-game. Shoutout to everyone for an overall successful night.",
        "Great place to dance as long as you bring your own dance partner. The staff creates a negative atmosphere because if you dance with the wrong girl, they make up lies to get you removed. Cash only. They operate on a 3-3-3 schedule of 3 swing (2 step), 3 line dance, 3 club songs. Every time I've been happy to arrive but left upset due to the bouncer staff. Also you will smell like cigarettes",

I wasn't able to experience the food here, but I would like to applaud how well received the Cowboys vs Aliens event with Tilt The Dirt was. Staff was pretty flexible, and the place was packed out for such a change of place/setting for this type of music. Every DJ did their part and brought their A-game. Shoutout to everyone for an overall successful night. Great place to dance as long as you bring your own dance partner. The staff creates a negative atmosphere because if you dance with the wrong girl, they make up lies to get you removed. Cash only. They operate on a 3-3-3 schedule of 3 swing (2 step), 3 line dance, 3 club songs. Every time I've been happy to arrive but left upset due to the bouncer staff. Also you will smell like cigarettes my personal favorite dance place in Oklahoma staff is super welcoming dj is always taking requests and working them into the night! love it here, favorite bar, great experience\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "I cannot rave enough at the customer service and music! The live band was amazing no weird smells I got a for pump from the drummer and a lady hugged me that\u2019s shows so much appreciation for one another. The grilled chicken was delicious I loved the fries as well! The ambiance was exactly what I needed after a bad experience at the revolution. I love live music this was amazing no lie. Be ready to show ID but the door man helped the door opened for me and got me seated in the front. I recommend this bar and  grill to tourist because they went above and beyond and they didn\u2019t have to. I felt comfortable and I loveddddddss the band",
        "This is a hard one for me. I was told these were the best wings in town. I went on a night that had a large group come in and had to wait for the food. The waitress was upfront about the long wait, but it got worse. They only had \"canned soda,\" but when she brought it to me it was poured in a glass and very flat. It seemed more like it was poured from a 2-liter that had been sitting open. I ordered 18 wings. After waiting two hours, she brought the food but it was \"boneless wings.\" She said the kitchen ran out of the \"good wings.\" Unfortunately, these weren't even boneless wings. they were tenderloin strips that had been cut into small bitesize chicken poppers. I paid for 18 wings and I got one bit chicken nuggets. Lastly, the music was too loud and the musician felt the need to do a guitar solo on every song.",
        "I went here in the middle of the day on a Wednesday. It was empty and I had the place to myself. The bartender was super friendly and made a great cocktail. I really enjoyed the feel of the place and it was one of the best drinks I\u2019ve ever had. I bet when the place is packed it is awesome too. I noticed a stage for live music as well.",
        "We've enjoyed this bar before but we're told it's under new ownership and the drink prices have skyrocketed. Charging $12 for liquor and $3 for the mixer? Who does that? Drinks were on the weak side as well. I'll drink elsewhere, thanks.\nAlso it was uncomfortably hot. Close the doors and crank up the a/c. I didn't dress up and put on cologne to sweat all over myself.\nOn the plus side, the bartenders and wait staff were friendly and sympathetic. I hate to complain to them as I know it's not their fault but I felt they should know.\nI hope they make some changes soon and turn this back into the cool, reasonably priced bar it used to be.",
        "A year ago, we randomly strolled into this place to use the bathroom. A band was performing and we ended up staying awhile because they were a vibe. Fast forward, last week we wanted some wings, did a Google search and ordered take out from here. The wings did not disappoint. The sweet potato fries were good too. We'll be back!"

The live band was amazing no weird smells I got a for pump from the drummer and a lady hugged me that\u2019s shows so much appreciation for one another. The grilled chicken was delicious I loved the fries as well! The ambiance was exactly what I needed after a bad experience at the revolution. I love live music this was amazing no lie. Be ready to show ID but the door man helped the door opened for me and got me seated in the front. I recommend this bar and  grill to tourist because they went above and beyond and they didn\u2019t have to. I felt comfortable and I loveddddddss the band This is a hard one for me. I was told these were the best wings in town. I went on a night that had a large group come in and had to wait for the food. The waitress was upfront about the long wait, but it got worse. They only had \"canned soda,\" but when she brought it to me it was poured in a glass and very flat. It seemed more like it was poured from a 2-liter that had been sitting open. I ordered 18 wings. After waiting two hours, she brought the food but it was \"boneless wings.\" She said the kitchen ran out of the \"good wings.\" Unfortunately, these weren't even boneless wings. they were tenderloin strips that had been cut into small bitesize chicken poppers. I paid for 18 wings and I got one bit chicken nuggets. Lastly, the music was too loud and the musician felt the need to do a guitar solo on every song. I went here in the middle of the day on a Wednesday. It was empty and I had the place to myself. The bartender was super friendly and made a great cocktail. I really enjoyed the feel of the place and it was one of the best drinks I\u2019ve ever had. I bet when the place is packed it is awesome too. I noticed a stage for live music as well. We've enjoyed this bar before but we're told it's under new ownership and the drink prices have skyrocketed. Charging $12 for liquor and $3 for the mixer? Who does that? Drinks were on the weak side as w...\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "Recommended by Dayton dancers, Nashville Palace turned out to be a surprisingly fun stop on our trip! We\u2019re used to dance venues playing unfamiliar music when we travel, but on Thursday this DJ nailed it\u2014his playlist included many of the same pop, hip hop, and country songs we dance to in Dayton and Columbus, Ohio. He rotated three line dances with three country swing songs, which kept things lively, though I wish he\u2019d leaned more into line dancing like we do back home.\nWhile country swing dominated the partner dancing, we managed to sneak in some West Coast Swing, East Coast Swing, and Cha Cha\u2014though not consistently. It was surprising that country swing was the only partner style featured. Sure, it\u2019s flashy and fun, but it lacks structure\u2014no step count, no shared rhythm. West Coast and Cha Cha are just as sexy, but they\u2019re actual dances. It left me wondering: why not teach other partner styles like West Coast Swing, Waltz, Country Two Step, or Night Club Two Step?\nFloor etiquette was another issue. Country swing dancers took up a lot of space and didn\u2019t seem aware of others trying to Two Step around the edge. At one point, a \u201ccountry swing hijack\u201d happened\u2014where dancers jumped in mid-song\u2014and while it was entertaining to watch, it sidelined a lot of us who just wanted to dance.\nThe line dance instructor did a great job teaching a beginner-friendly routine, but be warned: this isn\u2019t the place for casual dancers who only know the Electric Slide or Cupid Shuffle. Most of the line dancers were experienced, and you won\u2019t be able to pick up routines on the fly.\nOn the plus side, seating was decent with bar stools lining the dance floor, and the music was loud enough to energize the room without being overwhelming.",
        "Visiting from CA on a Monday night for bingo. We had a great night. The food was excellent, our waiter (Kohl?) was attentive and generous, bingo was fun and we won shirts and a little cash, overall everyone was friendly.",
        "6:30am breakfast before leaving town Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. Not busy at all\u2014we drove by later and the line was wrapped around the building. Friendly staff, quick service and yummy food!! We had cinnamon roll, lemon blueberry special (no whip) and little appetite plate. All delicious!!",
        "This was my first time here country line dancing and thought it was pretty different from all the dances I know. Friendly and fun so a nice Nashville\u2019s weekend",
        "Our company, Epique Realty, booked the entire back room at The Nashville Palace for an after-party event in June.  Nikki was our amazing event coordinator - she handled every detail like a PRO!  From food ordering, to vendor table set up, raffle tickets for door prizes, DJ & Line Dance Instructor, and MORE!  Our bartenders handled our 400+ guests that night and even created 2 signature cocktails for us.  Stephanie, Calista, Eric, Allie, all great! It was a BLAST!!  Everyone LOVED IT!"

      "embedding_text": "Name: The Nashville Palace\nDescription: Classic country music acts perform at this famed, rustic honkey-tonk with dancing & pub grub.\nReviews: Recommended by Dayton dancers, Nashville Palace turned out to be a surprisingly fun stop on our trip! We\u2019re used to dance venues playing unfamiliar music when we travel, but on Thursday this DJ nailed it\u2014his playlist included many of the same pop, hip hop, and country songs we dance to in Dayton and Columbus, Ohio. He rotated three line dances with three country swing songs, which kept things lively, though I wish he\u2019d leaned more into line dancing like we do back home.\nWhile country swing dominated the partner dancing, we managed to sneak in some West Coast Swing, East Coast Swing, and Cha Cha\u2014though not consistently. It was surprising that country swing was the only partner style featured. Sure, it\u2019s flashy and fun, but it lacks structure\u2014no step count, no shared rhythm. West Coast and Cha Cha are just as sexy, but they\u2019re actual dances. It left me wondering: why not teach other partner styles like West Coast Swing, Waltz, Country Two Step, or Night Club Two Step?\nFloor etiquette was another issue. Country swing dancers took up a lot of space and didn\u2019t seem aware of others trying to Two Step around the edge. At one point, a \u201ccountry swing hijack\u201d happened\u2014where dancers jumped in mid-song\u2014and while it was entertaining to watch, it sidelined a lot of us who just wanted to dance.\nThe line dance instructor did a great job teaching a beginner-friendly routine, but be warned: this isn\u2019t the place for casual dancers who only know the Electric Slide or Cupid Shuffle. Most of the line dancers were experienced, and you won\u2019t be able to pick up routines on the fly.\nOn the plus side, seating was decent with bar stools lining the dance floor, and the music was loud enough to energize the room without being overwhelming. Visiting from CA on a Monday night for bingo. We had a great night. The food was excellent, our waiter (Kohl?) was attentive and generous, bingo was fun and we won shirts and a little cash, overall everyone was friendly. 6:30am breakfast before leaving town Sa...\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "Great place for line dancing and drinking. However, security guards are on a power trip. That will throw you out for no reason. Based off false accusations. And then when you try to get to the bottom of while you're being kicked out, they start yelling at you and putting hands on you would not recommend unless you just like getting thrown out of places for no reason at all. I was outside in the smoking section minding my business by myself and got thrown out for touching somebody. Please explain to me how the hell you touched somebody when you're sitting by yourself.",
        "You can\u2019t beat having a good time and meeting new people. When dancing is involved. To find prime parking and seating it\u2019s best to go before 7:00pm (when they open) because the lines can get long. And for the young people (under 21) don\u2019t think you won\u2019t get caught for underage drinking. Trust me when I say they have secret workers around they do. And the owners have a well oiled relationship with Lebanon police department. They will not risk their license because you wanna be slick. Do your dirt off property. Other than that have fun",
        "Absolutely love it here. 3rd time coming and i got to come for Turkey Bowling. Made it to the Top 2. Had a lot of fun. Music was awesome, drinks were good, plenty of Dancing, they could really mix in a few more slow dances into the mix but great nonetheless.",
        "This place is absolutely the worst vehicle trapped for hours because the owners didn\u2019t want to get off their lazy behinds And call a tow truck to come tow a vehicle that was parked behind. Mine illegally don\u2019t come here. They don\u2019t have a clue what they\u2019re doing. They don\u2019t know how to run a bar and it might as well be a meat locker.",
        "Not a bad place for the locals because everyone knows everyone so it's easy for someone like me to enjoy because I can kick back enjoy my drink and observe the line dancing and it's never been a problem there with me throughout the years mostly"

      "embedding_text": "Name: Cahoots Dancehall and Honkytonk\nReviews: Great place for line dancing and drinking. However, security guards are on a power trip. That will throw you out for no reason. Based off false accusations. And then when you try to get to the bottom of while you're being kicked out, they start yelling at you and putting hands on you would not recommend unless you just like getting thrown out of places for no reason at all. I was outside in the smoking section minding my business by myself and got thrown out for touching somebody. Please explain to me how the hell you touched somebody when you're sitting by yourself. You can\u2019t beat having a good time and meeting new people. When dancing is involved. To find prime parking and seating it\u2019s best to go before 7:00pm (when they open) because the lines can get long. And for the young people (under 21) don\u2019t think you won\u2019t get caught for underage drinking. Trust me when I say they have secret workers around they do. And the owners have a well oiled relationship with Lebanon police department. They will not risk their license because you wanna be slick. Do your dirt off property. Other than that have fun Absolutely love it here. 3rd time coming and i got to come for Turkey Bowling. Made it to the Top 2. Had a lot of fun. Music was awesome, drinks were good, plenty of Dancing, they could really mix in a few more slow dances into the mix but great nonetheless. This place is absolutely the worst vehicle trapped for hours because the owners didn\u2019t want to get off their lazy behinds And call a tow truck to come tow a vehicle that was parked behind. Mine illegally don\u2019t come here. They don\u2019t have a clue what they\u2019re doing. They don\u2019t know how to run a bar and it might as well be a meat locker. Not a bad place for the locals because everyone knows everyone so it's easy for someone like me to enjoy because I can kick back enjoy my drink and observe the line dancing and it's never been a problem there with me throughout the years mostly\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "This place is everything you\u2019d want in a country line dance bar amazing music a lively dance floor, and a crowd that makes you feel welcome whether you\u2019re a pro or have two left feet. The instructors are patient and full of energy, and they make learning new moves fun and easy. Drinks are cold and well-made, and the staff is friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is upbeat but comfortable, so you can dance the night away or just enjoy watching. Definitely one of my favorite spots in town for a fun night out",
        "Literally the worst bar atmosphere I've ever experienced. The dj mostly played latin(Spanish speaking) music most of the night. This is supposed to be a country bar. Not a Latin bar. Will never be coming back! The cover is 12$! Which is also way over priced for what I just experienced. I'll be staying a regular at the one and only COTTON EYED JOES in KNOXVILLE TN!",
        "We have been here a few times and it has had great service and great entertainment! It\u2019s became one of my favorite weekend events",
        "They stopped letting people im on halloween to make the line feel longer so people would pay double to skip the line. Make people way over an hour to scam them"

      "embedding_text": "Name: Revolver Dance Hall of Cookeville\nReviews: DJ is garbage. Not sure why management/ownership doesn\u2019t make a change. Empty dance floor isn\u2019t good for business. 3 stars for service because the gals behind the bar and bounce staff were OUTSTANDING!\nThey are the only reason I will consider returning. This place is everything you\u2019d want in a country line dance bar amazing music a lively dance floor, and a crowd that makes you feel welcome whether you\u2019re a pro or have two left feet. The instructors are patient and full of energy, and they make learning new moves fun and easy. Drinks are cold and well-made, and the staff is friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is upbeat but comfortable, so you can dance the night away or just enjoy watching. Definitely one of my favorite spots in town for a fun night out Literally the worst bar atmosphere I've ever experienced. The dj mostly played latin(Spanish speaking) music most of the night. This is supposed to be a country bar. Not a Latin bar. Will never be coming back! The cover is 12$! Which is also way over priced for what I just experienced. I'll be staying a regular at the one and only COTTON EYED JOES in KNOXVILLE TN! We have been here a few times and it has had great service and great entertainment! It\u2019s became one of my favorite weekend events They stopped letting people im on halloween to make the line feel longer so people would pay double to skip the line. Make people way over an hour to scam them\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "Great good when the right cook is there! Jerry Prince is a Master in the kitchen! Great atmosphere. Scottie is the best teacher for dance lessons. He and his wife are very talented and work well together. Sometimes the patrons can get out of hand, yet Sherita runs a tight ship. The security guys are friendly, helpful and firm. Zero tolerance for weapons and drugs. Safe place for children when line dance lessons are given. Non smoking and all the lights on for these events. When you come regularly, you become family. If youre going to \"close the place down\" and stay until they close at 3am, be courteous and leave when asked. They have families too. Overall, I would visit this place every chance I get.... and I do",
        "The DJ played the music way too loud. He is blowing people away with too much volume..it looks like this place is headed to vacancy.",
        "Love going to see the people there. Great bartenders and waiters/waitress.",
        "I was surprised to see how nice the dance floor was. I went there for line dancing. I had a fabulous time. Cover charge was $5-more than reasonable. The hamburger and fries were delicious. Be sure to ask for the price before ordering. So there will be no surprises. Overall, I loved my experience.",
        "Great bar and awesome band enjoyed all the dancing would recommend for everyone to attend especially if your a Lion Dancer on New Year\u2019s Eve"

      "embedding_text": "Name: Mommas Country Bar And Dance Club\nReviews: Great good when the right cook is there! Jerry Prince is a Master in the kitchen! Great atmosphere. Scottie is the best teacher for dance lessons. He and his wife are very talented and work well together. Sometimes the patrons can get out of hand, yet Sherita runs a tight ship. The security guys are friendly, helpful and firm. Zero tolerance for weapons and drugs. Safe place for children when line dance lessons are given. Non smoking and all the lights on for these events. When you come regularly, you become family. If youre going to \"close the place down\" and stay until they close at 3am, be courteous and leave when asked. They have families too. Overall, I would visit this place every chance I get.... and I do The DJ played the music way too loud. He is blowing people away with too much volume..it looks like this place is headed to vacancy. Love going to see the people there. Great bartenders and waiters/waitress. I was surprised to see how nice the dance floor was. I went there for line dancing. I had a fabulous time. Cover charge was $5-more than reasonable. The hamburger and fries were delicious. Be sure to ask for the price before ordering. So there will be no surprises. Overall, I loved my experience. Great bar and awesome band enjoyed all the dancing would recommend for everyone to attend especially if your a Lion Dancer on New Year\u2019s Eve\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "Absolutely love this place. Ended up stopping in twice. First time was mid-week and they had a terrific 80' - 90's rock band playing.  We ended up staying nearly 3 hours. The band was fun and engaging.\n\nWent back a few days later, more crowded due to the weekend obviously. Had a great time then too.\n\nStaff is friendly and service was pretty fast. They have a great whiskey selection with quite a few allocated bottles. Normal beer and everything else if you want also.\n\nStop in and have a cold one.",
        "This place is awesome!! This is the place that you should visit for sure. Great bands and the atmosphere is not the processed version of a honky tonk that the larger venues offer. Love this place as we were allowed to take pictures of the band with our DSLR.. ( we asked security) so big thumbs up.",
        "Great place to have a few beers and listen to music. Especially if Jake Bleau is playing.",
        "Can\u2019t describe how great this place is. Unbelievable. As an old heavy metal junkie I walk in and hear the band Ballistic and they play all the great 70, 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s hard rock that only a metal head can truly appreciate. Great service, great music. Thank you !!! I\u2019m sure they have other great music genre\u2019s play there also. But Ballistic made my day!",
        "The drinks... so good! I would also say they are strong!\nEnjoyed our time listening to music and sipping signature drinks!\nI loved the cherry limeade and orchard punch. My husband loved his winter wonder mule. I'm not a fan of ginger beer, but he said it was great!!"

      "embedding_text": "Name: Whiskey Bent Saloon\nDescription: Vibrant, rustic tavern with mounted animal heads, offering beer, cocktails & a lineup of live music.\nReviews: Absolutely love this place. Ended up stopping in twice. First time was mid-week and they had a terrific 80' - 90's rock band playing.  We ended up staying nearly 3 hours. The band was fun and engaging.\n\nWent back a few days later, more crowded due to the weekend obviously. Had a great time then too.\n\nStaff is friendly and service was pretty fast. They have a great whiskey selection with quite a few allocated bottles. Normal beer and everything else if you want also.\n\nStop in and have a cold one. This place is awesome!! This is the place that you should visit for sure. Great bands and the atmosphere is not the processed version of a honky tonk that the larger venues offer. Love this place as we were allowed to take pictures of the band with our DSLR.. ( we asked security) so big thumbs up. Great place to have a few beers and listen to music. Especially if Jake Bleau is playing. Can\u2019t describe how great this place is. Unbelievable. As an old heavy metal junkie I walk in and hear the band Ballistic and they play all the great 70, 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s hard rock that only a metal head can truly appreciate. Great service, great music. Thank you !!! I\u2019m sure they have other great music genre\u2019s play there also. But Ballistic made my day! The drinks... so good! I would also say they are strong!\nEnjoyed our time listening to music and sipping signature drinks!\nI loved the cherry limeade and orchard punch. My husband loved his winter wonder mule. I'm not a fan of ginger beer, but he said it was great!!\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "The entry fee was $15. One beer was $9. The don't sell bottles, only cans.\n\nI visited the PBR Cowboy Bar on Fourth Street in Louisville yesterday and had a great time. The place has an energy that pulls you in as soon as you walk through the door. The atmosphere feels lively and welcoming, and it is the kind of bar where you can easily relax, enjoy a drink, and chat with people around you. The crowd was one of the highlights for me because everyone seemed friendly and ready to have a good time. It gave the whole night a fun and easygoing vibe.\n\nThe setup of the bar is also really cool. The cowboy influenced theme is done in a way that feels authentic without being over the top. The staff works hard and keeps the place running smoothly, and I never had to wait long for anything. You can tell they know how to create an enjoyable experience for visitors.\n\nThe only thing that I think could be improved is the music. I really enjoy country music but what was playing last night felt a bit strange. It was hard to dance to and the lyrics were very difficult to understand. I think the audio quality could be improved, which would make the music fit the atmosphere much better. Other than that, everything about my visit was excellent. I would definitely come back and I can recommend it to anyone who wants a fun night out in Louisville.",
        "Well...all the tables in this joint are \" reserved\".  When I inquired when they may be opened up, the bartender said that they were \" reserved for bottle service only\".  That puzzled me so I asked, how much is bottle service and was promptly told, \" I dont have that info\"...you gotta be kidding me!\n\nAnywho....bar has no seating and very limited outside seating.  This is sad...the live band is playing to two bartenders and and in guy standing at the bar, because every seat is \" reserved\".\n\nLets do math...reserved couch seats 10 folks and any good bar should turn that over at 35.00 per seat.  They way I see it tonight....you must be raking it in on the weekend.  8 seperate seating areas empty....minus 10 guests at 35.00 each...wow..2800.00/hr on low end for DT Louisville...im sure my numbers are weak on per seat average, but was giving it a fair chance.",
        "Cool place! Drinks were good, service was great, and they even have a bull you can ride. If you\u2019re in downtown Louisville and tolerate country music, check it out!",
        "Extremely disappointed with the way this was handled. I lost my wallet and went back to ask if anyone had turned it in, and the staff was completely unhelpful. They clearly don\u2019t take lost items seriously.\nThe manager was especially rude when I asked for help\u2014she didn\u2019t seem to care at all and wouldn\u2019t even bother to look around or check properly. The lack of basic customer service and empathy was shocking. I would not recommend this place based on how they treat people in situations like this.",
        "This is one of the best bars in Louisville for nightlife.  Located right in 4th Street Live, this bar's cowboy themed bar provides a terrific atmosphere for those that like music, dancing, and/or riding a mechanical bull.\n\nThe drink prices are about what you'd expect at a place like this.\n\nThe security and staff are quite prevalent so it's probably not best to get too far out of line, despite it being such a hype and rambunctious environment.\n\nThere are a few stairs that you can go up and  there are spots to sit down in chairs in more of a lounge type setting.\n\nAnother cool part of this place is that they are open until 3am on weekends. Definitely a good place to go when all of the other bars are closed.\n\nOverall, this bar is definitely worth checking out if you are looking for good nightlife."

      "embedding_text": "Name: PBR Louisville: A Cowboy Bar\nDescription: Airy, cowboy-themed bar & lounge with mechanical bull riding in modern digs with a lively ambiance.\nReviews: The entry fee was $15. One beer was $9. The don't sell bottles, only cans.\n\nI visited the PBR Cowboy Bar on Fourth Street in Louisville yesterday and had a great time. The place has an energy that pulls you in as soon as you walk through the door. The atmosphere feels lively and welcoming, and it is the kind of bar where you can easily relax, enjoy a drink, and chat with people around you. The crowd was one of the highlights for me because everyone seemed friendly and ready to have a good time. It gave the whole night a fun and easygoing vibe.\n\nThe setup of the bar is also really cool. The cowboy influenced theme is done in a way that feels authentic without being over the top. The staff works hard and keeps the place running smoothly, and I never had to wait long for anything. You can tell they know how to create an enjoyable experience for visitors.\n\nThe only thing that I think could be improved is the music. I really enjoy country music but what was playing last night felt a bit strange. It was hard to dance to and the lyrics were very difficult to understand. I think the audio quality could be improved, which would make the music fit the atmosphere much better. Other than that, everything about my visit was excellent. I would definitely come back and I can recommend it to anyone who wants a fun night out in Louisville. Well...all the tables in this joint are \" reserved\".  When I inquired when they may be opened up, the bartender said that they were \" reserved for bottle service only\".  That puzzled me so I asked, how much is bottle service and was promptly told, \" I dont have that info\"...you gotta be kidding me!\n\nAnywho....bar has no seating and very limited outside seating.  This is sad...the live band is playing to two bartenders and and in guy standing at the bar, because every seat is \" reserved\".\n\nLets do math...reserved couch seats 10 folks and any good bar should turn that over at 35.00 per seat.  They way I see it tonight....you must be raking it in on ...\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "My sister and I go to get out for karyoke ONLY not blow $ on alcohol that we can't drink really on our meds and the bartender decided to state it is loitering if I do not purchase anything so he has to charge me for an open cup of bar water now. Water. Really loitering begged to come back we sing awesome and been trying to bring in more business then EMPTY TABLES but hey discrimination against medical and then decided to seem to make it known still watching the behavior medically not supposed to drink not my fault people buy them anyway for me doesn't mean I drink it\nThe bartender went and removed our songs from the dj list because we refuse to pay for water and only come out to relax with no alcohol also not driving under the influence and left high and dry from life\nWaiting for the cops to arrive for loitering when I have been here every weekend and HAVE SPENT $ HERE WHEN THE WOMEN WERE WORKING AND MY BROTHER WAS WITH US actually spent a lot that night. Nice I love knowing the licensing I have!!!!!!!",
        "The idea of public indoor smoking took me back to a less sensitive crybaby time\nBtw I\u2019m Not a smoker but  I do love the idea of everyone made to feel comfortable yet still vibing with each despite any personal preferences in public spaces .\n\nGames , able to bring your own food in ? Super awesome it sounds like a huge fun kick back",
        "Went to this bar to have a good time with friends to sing some karaoke. I have diabetes and can't drink so I went up to the bar and ask for a cup of water and the bartender/ manager said 50 cents I'm like for a cup of water and he's like yup. This is my first time at a bar where the charge you for a cup of water so I said nevermind without arguing. Then the next thing I knew the DJ came up to me saying I was knock off the list because the bartender/ manager said to. This is not right at all and I'm very upset with this. My sister medically can not drink either the stress is killing her so her medical doctors told us to do this and we have a medical card that covers it and this is discrimination the bartender wants to state loitering this is wrong we have actually tried to bring in tons more business nobody even heard of this place and people LOVE OUR SINGING WE JUST SANG BON JOVI",
        "My favorite bar. All the bartenders are great. They don't serve food but you can bring food in. They have pool tables, darts, slots, karaoke,  live music, great drink prices,  and you can smoke inside. Murica!"

Great drinks! Great prices! My sister and I go to get out for karyoke ONLY not blow $ on alcohol that we can't drink really on our meds and the bartender decided to state it is loitering if I do not purchase anything so he has to charge me for an open cup of bar water now. Water. Really loitering begged to come back we sing awesome and been trying to bring in more business then EMPTY TABLES but hey discrimination against medical and then decided to seem to make it known still watching the behavior medically not supposed to drink not my fault people buy them anyway for me doesn't mean I drink it\nThe bartender went and removed our songs from the dj list because we refuse to pay for water and only come out to relax with no alcohol also not driving under the influence and left high and dry from life\nWaiting for the cops to arrive for loitering when I have been here every weekend and HAVE SPENT $ HERE WHEN THE WOMEN WERE WORKING AND MY BROTHER WAS WITH US actually spent a lot that night. Nice I love knowing the licensing I have!!!!!!! The idea of public indoor smoking took me back to a less sensitive crybaby time\nBtw I\u2019m Not a smoker but  I do love the idea of everyone made to feel comfortable yet still vibing with each despite any personal preferences in public spaces .\n\nGames , able to bring your own food in ? Super awesome it sounds like a huge fun kick back Went to this bar to have a good time with friends to sing some karaoke. I have diabetes and can't drink so I went up to the bar and ask for a cup of water and the bartender/ manager said 50 cents I'm like for a cup of water and he's like yup. This is my first time at a bar where the charge you for a cup of water so I said nevermind without arguing. Then the next thing I knew the DJ came up to me saying I was knock off the list because the bartender/ manager said to. This is not right at all and I'm very upset with this. My sister medically can not drink either the stress is killing ...\nCategory: honky tonk"

Located in the Heart of Downtown Corbin. Offering a wide variety of music types and many themed events throughout the year. Management and Bar team are great with taking care of everyone's needs. Offers rooftop seating The energy in this place on a Saturday night is DEFINITELY CONTAGIOUS!!! I've never been to a country bar in my life, everyone was so FRIENDLY!! I was drug onto the dance floor and had NO idea what I was doing. The bartenders remember people by name. Service is fast!! I'll definitely be going back. Great place \ud83d\udd25 They're refilling their liquor bottles with water. Never had a shot that tasted so much like water in my life and the floor is sticky everywhere you walk. Austin city is one of the best live music venues in Lexington. it's gotta long, rich history where many stars got their start. most importantly, they certainly support local music! What an absolute experience! I was visiting from Ohio and wanted to check out Austin City Saloon and let me tell you it did not disappoint! The staff are super friendly and helpful. A true vibrant place for anyone who loves to dance and has an appreciation for country music.\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "We celebrated my daughter's 21st Birthday at Bobby Mackey's 8/29/2025. Yes, it is in the new temporary location but once you step through the doors IT IS BOBBY MACKEY'S!! The staff were Awesome! We ranged in age from 21 through 65 and we all had a blast. We danced, sang karaoke, laughed and celebrated life!! Bobby Mackey and his band are as Amazing as they have always been! Thank you Bobby Mackey and Staff for helping us make my Daughter Angel's 21st The Best!!!",
        "Bobby Mackey's Honky-tonk is truly one of a kind!  Bobby performs multiple sets of his famous favorites, and the dj spins linedancing tunes in between sets. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udfb6",
        "On spring break and in town, decided to swing by the infamous Bobby Mackey's! The new location is in a different town maybe 20 minutes away from the original location on Licking Pike road in Wilder KY. As an avid Ghost Adventures fan, I was compelled to see the infamous and haunted location before it's demolished. Feel sad that such a historic and popular building is being torn down. Didn't go inside the new location as it was closed.",
        "Definitely a cool little spot if your interested in honkey tonk music, playing a round of pool, enjoying a drink or into paranormal investigating.  Very nostalgic to visit. Good gift shop inside as well.",
        "My wife and I did one of the Sunday ghost tours on 8/27/18. Had a blast learning about this site. This place is FULL of activity and we caught several orbs as well as felt several weird vibes. We will return soon! Also special thanks again to our guide from Gatekeeper Paranormal, Angie."

Yes, it is in the new temporary location but once you step through the doors IT IS BOBBY MACKEY'S!! The staff were Awesome! We ranged in age from 21 through 65 and we all had a blast. We danced, sang karaoke, laughed and celebrated life!! Bobby Mackey and his band are as Amazing as they have always been! Thank you Bobby Mackey and Staff for helping us make my Daughter Angel's 21st The Best!!! Bobby Mackey's Honky-tonk is truly one of a kind!  Bobby performs multiple sets of his famous favorites, and the dj spins linedancing tunes in between sets. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udfb6 On spring break and in town, decided to swing by the infamous Bobby Mackey's! The new location is in a different town maybe 20 minutes away from the original location on Licking Pike road in Wilder KY. As an avid Ghost Adventures fan, I was compelled to see the infamous and haunted location before it's demolished. Feel sad that such a historic and popular building is being torn down. Didn't go inside the new location as it was closed. Definitely a cool little spot if your interested in honkey tonk music, playing a round of pool, enjoying a drink or into paranormal investigating.  Very nostalgic to visit. Good gift shop inside as well. My wife and I did one of the Sunday ghost tours on 8/27/18. Had a blast learning about this site. This place is FULL of activity and we caught several orbs as well as felt several weird vibes. We will return soon! Also special thanks again to our guide from Gatekeeper Paranormal, Angie.\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "Ordered the brisket dip to go, which had a huge chunk of super hard dried out inedible meat, even when attempting to soak in the au jus.  Expensive sandwich with the low quality meat I had to throw away.  I should have known upon walking into a bbq place that had zero aroma of any smoked meats.  Shoestring fries were good, but won't bother returning to try anything else.",
        "Walked here from our hotel with some coworkers while in town. The drinks were good and both the bartenders were really fun and friendly. The food was good, could have used a little salt for our preference. The buffalo dip (not pictured) was a big hit with the table. We were there on karaoke night which we enjoyed hearing people\u2019s performances, just chilling and chatting.",
        "Morgan was an amazing bartender and made my experience so enjoyable! She was super friendly and welcoming. Morgan paid attention to every detail, made great drink recommendations, and mixed everything perfectly. She truly cares about making sure customers have a great time. I\u2019ll definitely be back, and I\u2019ll be asking for Morgan again!",
        "Ordered on door dash tonight pork was just the scraps. Mold on the bottom of the roll order the kettle chips and most of them were burnt. Green beans  and brisket were just ok  overall I am still hungry after paying over 100 for a family of 4.  The only thing that was good was the Mac n cheese. Also I got 3 extra boxes of loaded chips that I did not even order. Overall I will not be ordering this again"

      "embedding_text": "Name: Shiners On The Levee\nReviews: Phenomenal food, service, and atmosphere at Shiners! My husband and I appreciate a great restaurant and this was top notch! We will be back. Ordered the brisket dip to go, which had a huge chunk of super hard dried out inedible meat, even when attempting to soak in the au jus.  Expensive sandwich with the low quality meat I had to throw away.  I should have known upon walking into a bbq place that had zero aroma of any smoked meats.  Shoestring fries were good, but won't bother returning to try anything else. Walked here from our hotel with some coworkers while in town. The drinks were good and both the bartenders were really fun and friendly. The food was good, could have used a little salt for our preference. The buffalo dip (not pictured) was a big hit with the table. We were there on karaoke night which we enjoyed hearing people\u2019s performances, just chilling and chatting. Morgan was an amazing bartender and made my experience so enjoyable! She was super friendly and welcoming. Morgan paid attention to every detail, made great drink recommendations, and mixed everything perfectly. She truly cares about making sure customers have a great time. I\u2019ll definitely be back, and I\u2019ll be asking for Morgan again! Ordered on door dash tonight pork was just the scraps. Mold on the bottom of the roll order the kettle chips and most of them were burnt. Green beans  and brisket were just ok  overall I am still hungry after paying over 100 for a family of 4.  The only thing that was good was the Mac n cheese. Also I got 3 extra boxes of loaded chips that I did not even order. Overall I will not be ordering this again\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "Music was great. The waitresses were adorable. I'm 51 and down for a good time. I went on Saturday night around 10:00. I am pretty sure everyone else there was under 40. I love watching people have a good time. It was shoulder to shoulder crowded. I felt a little \"too old for this shit.\" and was mildly annoyed with myself for getting old.",
        "Does this look like a $13 sandwich to you? It was all bun. Also, the poor bartender was by herself at 5 pm on a Wednesday. We didn\u2019t take it out on here because it wasn\u2019t her fault but very disappointing. Lastly, this place charges almost 4% for using your credit card to pay. This is not posted on the menu nor the outside door. I checked before we left. If you\u2019re going to do that, post it.",
        "OMG fun place to spend Saturday night before Christmas eve.\n\nGreat food...tasty burger. Chicken breast salad.  Cowboy pasta.  Toasted ravs. Breaded mushrooms. All were very tasty and priced right.\n\nAnd live entertainment guitar player.  Really a neat  place.      Scotty our (new) waiter made our dinner even better. Smiling happy attentive accurate thorough. The best!\n\nGreat family setting on Main Street.  We will be back for sure.",
        "If I could give their service zero stars I would. Went on a night out with my friends, asked for a round of drinks (shots) for a group of five and the male bartender said straight to my face \u201cno\u201d. He only served us pre made shots. Maybe don\u2019t work at a bar? Also not to mention they weren\u2019t super busy.\nI typically leave fairly good reviews and like to look at the bright side of things and give (especially small business) the benefit of the doubt.\nThis experience was so rude and I will not be returning.",
        "Came for the live music but left after trying to order drinks and the bartender said she\u2019d throw me and my friends out simply for advocating for myself as she kept serving others even though I had been waiting nearly 10 mins. I politely pointed out to her she had skipped me several times and then she threatened to kick us out for that, so we made it easier and left. I\u2019d recommend not allowing your bartenders to drink so they can be most efficient and respectful to patrons while maintaining order within the establishment. It was also nearly shoulder to shoulder deep with people. Dangerously crowded."

      "embedding_text": "Name: Main Street Honky Tonk\nReviews: Music was great. The waitresses were adorable. I'm 51 and down for a good time. I went on Saturday night around 10:00. I am pretty sure everyone else there was under 40. I love watching people have a good time. It was shoulder to shoulder crowded. I felt a little \"too old for this shit.\" and was mildly annoyed with myself for getting old. Does this look like a $13 sandwich to you? It was all bun. Also, the poor bartender was by herself at 5 pm on a Wednesday. We didn\u2019t take it out on here because it wasn\u2019t her fault but very disappointing. Lastly, this place charges almost 4% for using your credit card to pay. This is not posted on the menu nor the outside door. I checked before we left. If you\u2019re going to do that, post it. OMG fun place to spend Saturday night before Christmas eve.\n\nGreat food...tasty burger. Chicken breast salad.  Cowboy pasta.  Toasted ravs. Breaded mushrooms. All were very tasty and priced right.\n\nAnd live entertainment guitar player.  Really a neat  place.      Scotty our (new) waiter made our dinner even better. Smiling happy attentive accurate thorough. The best!\n\nGreat family setting on Main Street.  We will be back for sure. If I could give their service zero stars I would. Went on a night out with my friends, asked for a round of drinks (shots) for a group of five and the male bartender said straight to my face \u201cno\u201d. He only served us pre made shots. Maybe don\u2019t work at a bar? Also not to mention they weren\u2019t super busy.\nI typically leave fairly good reviews and like to look at the bright side of things and give (especially small business) the benefit of the doubt.\nThis experience was so rude and I will not be returning. Came for the live music but left after trying to order drinks and the bartender said she\u2019d throw me and my friends out simply for advocating for myself as she kept serving others even though I had been waiting nearly 10 mins. I politely pointed out to her she had skipped me several times and then she threatened to kick us ...\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "I would not recommend this place.\nIt's not a customer friendly experience for our visit there, I would not tip that singer to sing your song, good luck if you go to this place.",
        "Really cool bar .  You can tell from the crown molding it's an old building that has been restored .  It looks very nice .   Staff was all very nice .  Had a awesome band playing there as well that night .  We will definitely be back",
        "Had such a good time here! I can't speak on the drinks since I don't drink but it was so fun!",
        "Had the best night ever for my bachelorette trip. Went in on a Thursday and the owner was so friendly and nice. The live music was perfect. We got to dance and have fun. The atmosphere was perfect! Highly recommended!!"

Went to another bar around the area. Honky Tonk never did open. Complete disappointment. Dont trust their website I would not recommend this place.\nIt's not a customer friendly experience for our visit there, I would not tip that singer to sing your song, good luck if you go to this place. Really cool bar .  You can tell from the crown molding it's an old building that has been restored .  It looks very nice .   Staff was all very nice .  Had a awesome band playing there as well that night .  We will definitely be back Had such a good time here! I can't speak on the drinks since I don't drink but it was so fun! Had the best night ever for my bachelorette trip. Went in on a Thursday and the owner was so friendly and nice. The live music was perfect. We got to dance and have fun. The atmosphere was perfect! Highly recommended!!\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "We were there doing the lessons for line dancing. We didn't participate, but thoroughly enjoyed watching. I had the smash burger, best I've ever had. Different kinds of beef in one. Very good. Clean, nice atmosphere. Enjoyed the visit with our waitress.",
        "Food was good. It was during Bikefest so it wouldn't be fait to rate service. They do need to have a couple of designated bartenders. All working were making drinks.",
        "Stopped in during the week for a quick drink and dinner. they had music on in the background, but it was not overbearing and obnoxious. The establishment was extremely clean and the employees were friendly. The bartender was helpful and made some suggestions. I opted for the pulled chicken and french fries. Food was great, tons of flavor, well seasoned and a good portion. I also had a couple mixed drinks. Definitely good bartenders",
        "FUUUN place!!! Good bar food and service. Owner is a GEM who takes her customers seriously! Live bands on Fri and Sat nights. A BIG dance floor adds to the experience. A MUST SEE!",
        "It was an overall great experience. All employees were polite and extremely helpful. Prices were not bad for a specialty location. The mix drinks were a little higher than I am used to. It is a great place to eat, drink and dance!"

I had the smash burger, best I've ever had. Different kinds of beef in one. Very good. Clean, nice atmosphere. Enjoyed the visit with our waitress. Food was good. It was during Bikefest so it wouldn't be fait to rate service. They do need to have a couple of designated bartenders. All working were making drinks. Stopped in during the week for a quick drink and dinner. they had music on in the background, but it was not overbearing and obnoxious. The establishment was extremely clean and the employees were friendly. The bartender was helpful and made some suggestions. I opted for the pulled chicken and french fries. Food was great, tons of flavor, well seasoned and a good portion. I also had a couple mixed drinks. Definitely good bartenders FUUUN place!!! Good bar food and service. Owner is a GEM who takes her customers seriously! Live bands on Fri and Sat nights. A BIG dance floor adds to the experience. A MUST SEE! It was an overall great experience. All employees were polite and extremely helpful. Prices were not bad for a specialty location. The mix drinks were a little higher than I am used to. It is a great place to eat, drink and dance!\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "Really fun country bar in downtown Columbia. I actually performed there with Michael Leatherman, a great artist from Nashville. Check out his music! His new single, How Close We Can Get, just dropped.",
        "Cold Drinks. Hopping crowd. Great tunes. As busy as they were? Bartenders stay ahead of demand.\nWill visit again. Best honkytonk around.\n(Was kinda cool listening to this or that song, and seeing the original artists picture on the wall\ud83d\ude0e)",
        "Karaoke night is super fun. One of the best genuine honkytonk bars in the area. Feels like I\u2019m in Nashville when I step inside!",
        "They had a live band, Chris Morano, while I was there. They were good. I enjoyed it."

      "embedding_text": "Name: Nash Vegas\nReviews: The DJ at Nash Vegas was just indicted on 7 felony charges for domestic violence on January 9th, 2026. These charges follow a decade of domestic violence against women according to casenet and his background check. Do better for the safety of the women in this establishment. Really fun country bar in downtown Columbia. I actually performed there with Michael Leatherman, a great artist from Nashville. Check out his music! His new single, How Close We Can Get, just dropped. Cold Drinks. Hopping crowd. Great tunes. As busy as they were? Bartenders stay ahead of demand.\nWill visit again. Best honkytonk around.\n(Was kinda cool listening to this or that song, and seeing the original artists picture on the wall\ud83d\ude0e) Karaoke night is super fun. One of the best genuine honkytonk bars in the area. Feels like I\u2019m in Nashville when I step inside! They had a live band, Chris Morano, while I was there. They were good. I enjoyed it.\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "A true one-of-a-kind live music experience.  Go early, bring some dinner, and bring some cash for the bar.  We saw Dale Watson here and it was one of the best shows I've ever been to.  It's a very intimate/homey sort of setting.  There's a little bit of room to dance and you're encouraged to do so.  It's a good little drive out of town though, so don't bring too much cash for the bar!",
        "I don\u2019t think they server food or at least I didn\u2019t see any. But the atmosphere was amazing, the band was awesome, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching all the line dancers. Outside patio was great for taking breaks and I really enjoyed the ponds.",
        "Gene\u2019s country club was everything I needed in my life on that specific weekend. It was such a fun and awesome atmosphere to be in. Cheap buckets of beer were a plus. I will be back, but can\u2019t say I will ever learn to dance like everyone else, unfortunately.",
        "Love this so far. So many great two step and one step songs.\n\nI dont usually love love live bands because im bad at dancing to it but can I really knock them for it! They really do put alot effort since they only operate once a week and it shows!\n\nNo food (only drinks) and cash only. Sorta limiting but overall love it! They got a good mix of line dance and partner dance. If you're from a utah, Arizona and Texas and visit here it's a great experience.",
        "Great atmosphere! Music/bands were phenomenal and kept the hype going all night. We loved watching the crowd jump in and dance to the great music. Staff was kind, and cheerful. Everything very clean and well managed. We will definitely be back!!"

      "embedding_text": "Name: Gene's Country Club\nReviews: A true one-of-a-kind live music experience.  Go early, bring some dinner, and bring some cash for the bar.  We saw Dale Watson here and it was one of the best shows I've ever been to.  It's a very intimate/homey sort of setting.  There's a little bit of room to dance and you're encouraged to do so.  It's a good little drive out of town though, so don't bring too much cash for the bar! I don\u2019t think they server food or at least I didn\u2019t see any. But the atmosphere was amazing, the band was awesome, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching all the line dancers. Outside patio was great for taking breaks and I really enjoyed the ponds. Gene\u2019s country club was everything I needed in my life on that specific weekend. It was such a fun and awesome atmosphere to be in. Cheap buckets of beer were a plus. I will be back, but can\u2019t say I will ever learn to dance like everyone else, unfortunately. Love this so far. So many great two step and one step songs.\n\nI dont usually love love live bands because im bad at dancing to it but can I really knock them for it! They really do put alot effort since they only operate once a week and it shows!\n\nNo food (only drinks) and cash only. Sorta limiting but overall love it! They got a good mix of line dance and partner dance. If you're from a utah, Arizona and Texas and visit here it's a great experience. Great atmosphere! Music/bands were phenomenal and kept the hype going all night. We loved watching the crowd jump in and dance to the great music. Staff was kind, and cheerful. Everything very clean and well managed. We will definitely be back!!\nCategory: honky tonk"

This place is BUSY but they handle it like rockstars!! You can put a dollar on the wall that's collected at the end of the year and donated to charity!! They also have live music everyday!! The food was good, too!! If you're in the neighborhood, I highly recommend this one!!",
        "Great margaritas!! It's so fun to see all the history and staff has fun with clientele. Great souvenir options and the live music is a great touch!",
        "I think this is a great place. I love the outside and how it looks and it\u2019s just like it. Text you back but not in 30 kind of way because everything is definitely clean wink wink I just kidding. It\u2019s pretty clean actually.",
        "Another visit Dec 2023. It doesn\u2019t change from the last time. Always a good time and you get exactly what you expect from a classic dive cowboy bar!it\u2019s just a Great small box cowboy dive bar. The decor is memorable and funny, esp the \u201cbig butt chairs\u201d! We were there on a Sunday and they had a cowboy singer strumming a guitar and a few folks got up to dance in the middle of the bar! Good beer and a fun place to wet your whistle!\nVictorB",
        "Cool hole in the war bar with live music located right in Old Town Scottsdale. Good priced drinks, and great atmosphere. No thrills at this bar, just an amazing time. It\u2019s very small, so be ready to pack in, drink and sing until your heart is content."

My first time in and it did not disappoint!!  Awesome atmosphere with the friendliest staff!! So nice to be greeted with a giant smile!! This place is BUSY but they handle it like rockstars!! You can put a dollar on the wall that's collected at the end of the year and donated to charity!! They also have live music everyday!! The food was good, too!! If you're in the neighborhood, I highly recommend this one!! Great margaritas!! It's so fun to see all the history and staff has fun with clientele. Great souvenir options and the live music is a great touch! I think this is a great place. I love the outside and how it looks and it\u2019s just like it. Text you back but not in 30 kind of way because everything is definitely clean wink wink I just kidding. It\u2019s pretty clean actually. Another visit Dec 2023. It doesn\u2019t change from the last time. Always a good time and you get exactly what you expect from a classic dive cowboy bar!it\u2019s just a Great small box cowboy dive bar. The decor is memorable and funny, esp the \u201cbig butt chairs\u201d! We were there on a Sunday and they had a cowboy singer strumming a guitar and a few folks got up to dance in the middle of the bar! Good beer and a fun place to wet your whistle!\nVictorB Cool hole in the war bar with live music located right in Old Town Scottsdale. Good priced drinks, and great atmosphere. No thrills at this bar, just an amazing time. It\u2019s very small, so be ready to pack in, drink and sing until your heart is content.\nCategory: honky tonk"

Mike and his staff were amazing from the moment we walked in - making sure everything was perfect.  They were friendly and helpful and the attention to detail truly elevated the entire experience! If you are looking for a venue to hold a group gathering, I would highly recommend Whiskey Row.  You will not be disappointed!",
        "Great spot! Service was awesome, waitresses were \ud83d\udd25, drinks were delicious. We watched the Canello vs Crawford fight there and had a blast!",
        "Went to the Broncos watch party and had SO MUCH fun!! Mike was awesome and took great care of us. It was PACKED and service was still phenomenal!!\n\nAlso fire DJ\n\nDef coming back!",
        "Came to hear the live music on NYE, but they were cut short !!! Great musicians Casey & Matt!! & Great service! The GM was very welcoming & asked our plans for the night. However, It\u2019s hard to enjoy genuine performances if corporate cuts the music short :( overall glad to enjoy the live music & entertainment!",
        "Mike, the manager, was great! He checked in on us multiple times to make sure we were happy with everything. The atmosphere was lively and friendly and we can\u2019t wait to come back."

Mike and his staff were amazing from the moment we walked in - making sure everything was perfect.  They were friendly and helpful and the attention to detail truly elevated the entire experience! If you are looking for a venue to hold a group gathering, I would highly recommend Whiskey Row.  You will not be disappointed! Great spot! Service was awesome, waitresses were \ud83d\udd25, drinks were delicious. We watched the Canello vs Crawford fight there and had a blast! Went to the Broncos watch party and had SO MUCH fun!! Mike was awesome and took great care of us. It was PACKED and service was still phenomenal!!\n\nAlso fire DJ\n\nDef coming back! Came to hear the live music on NYE, but they were cut short !!! Great musicians Casey & Matt!! & Great service! The GM was very welcoming & asked our plans for the night. However, It\u2019s hard to enjoy genuine performances if corporate cuts the music short :( overall glad to enjoy the live music & entertainment! Mike, the manager, was great! He checked in on us multiple times to make sure we were happy with everything. The atmosphere was lively and friendly and we can\u2019t wait to come back.\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "Big issue trying to get seated. They won't let a single diner sit in a 4 person table or higher. Just do it anyways.\n\nRIBS were definitely top notch as was fries and biscuits.\n\nCountry cover band was playing and they were average. Good crowd for a $10 Friday night cover charge.\nHad a well done burger and cole  slaw for$15",
        "Great place for line dancing and cocktails.  Skip the food and enjoy a good time on the dance floor.  The food is mediocre at best.",
        "Camille had roses and food ready for my wife's 1 year anniversary! She was amazing and took amazing care of us.  Great music great dancing and our favorite spot every time we come to Scottsdale!!  Thank you Camille",
        "Fun! Great outdoor seating when the weather cooperates. Attentive bar staff. Good liquor selection. Ribs were tender and flavorful. Could use a few more food selections (maybe salmon?). The band wasn't overly loud, even with a dozen members. Close parking is a bit limited.",
        "This place was a lot of fun! Line dancing lessons were a blast. The instructor was great and very helpful. I didn't step on any toes, so I call that a win. We had appetizers that were delicious. The chicken bites and jalape\u00f1o poppers hit the spot with a cold drink. The atmosphere of this restaurant is just downright fun!"

They won't let a single diner sit in a 4 person table or higher. Just do it anyways.\n\nRIBS were definitely top notch as was fries and biscuits.\n\nCountry cover band was playing and they were average. Good crowd for a $10 Friday night cover charge.\nHad a well done burger and cole  slaw for$15 Great place for line dancing and cocktails.  Skip the food and enjoy a good time on the dance floor.  The food is mediocre at best. Camille had roses and food ready for my wife's 1 year anniversary! She was amazing and took amazing care of us.  Great music great dancing and our favorite spot every time we come to Scottsdale!!  Thank you Camille Fun! Great outdoor seating when the weather cooperates. Attentive bar staff. Good liquor selection. Ribs were tender and flavorful. Could use a few more food selections (maybe salmon?). The band wasn't overly loud, even with a dozen members. Close parking is a bit limited. This place was a lot of fun! Line dancing lessons were a blast. The instructor was great and very helpful. I didn't step on any toes, so I call that a win. We had appetizers that were delicious. The chicken bites and jalape\u00f1o poppers hit the spot with a cold drink. The atmosphere of this restaurant is just downright fun!\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "Had a great time in the VIP area.  Lucky to have that spot because the rest of the place was so crowded.  We had all you can eat buffet and a private bar.  Service was great up there.  Rodeo was fun.  Bathroom situation needs improved.  One bathroom for hundreds of drinking patrons.  Lines were insane.  Otherwise we had a great time.",
        "Rustic rodeo Western vibe which is cool if that is what you're looking for. Food was very average in our mid-afternoon experience.\n\nThey have a photo booth with their branding on it. Horrible quality, clearly something is wrong with it. We showed the photos to our waitress and asked for a refund of the $20 we spent. She acknowledged they've had problems with it but thought it was fixed. She went to talk to her manager and said there's nothing they will do.\n\nSo $20 wasted on photos that are absolutely useless.",
        "Fun place, very rustic. VIP seats are expensive, and we were initially given a table with restricted views so we could only see half the arena. We had to move to the arena seats for the first part of the show to be able to see properly. We were then offered another table with a better view as a party did not show. Food was good BBQ buffet style, but got cold quickly. Would have been nice to have a sweet dessert like a bit of apple pie or a brownie to help justify the $65 charge.\nThey then over charged us by not deducting the full deposit we paid from the final bill. They did resolve this very quickly.",
        "We went for the Wednesday night bull riding. The service from the doorman to the DJ was top notch. We received great parking information, easy no-hassle entry, personal attention while buying swag, clean restrooms, quick bar service in multiple areas, DJ mix range was impressive as it spanned country to hip hop, new music to classics, the ring announcer kept the crowd engaged and introduced each rider and bull.",
        "What a really fun place to visit. Great country vibes and even a house band 5 nights a week. Food was decent and the service is fantastic. Definitely worth stopping by when in the area."

      "embedding_text": "Name: Buffalo Chip Saloon and Steakhouse\nDescription: A dance hall, saloon & mini-rodeo, this Western roadhouse also serves chops, fried fish & tacos.\nReviews: Had a great time in the VIP area.  Lucky to have that spot because the rest of the place was so crowded.  We had all you can eat buffet and a private bar.  Service was great up there.  Rodeo was fun.  Bathroom situation needs improved.  One bathroom for hundreds of drinking patrons.  Lines were insane.  Otherwise we had a great time. Rustic rodeo Western vibe which is cool if that is what you're looking for. Food was very average in our mid-afternoon experience.\n\nThey have a photo booth with their branding on it. Horrible quality, clearly something is wrong with it. We showed the photos to our waitress and asked for a refund of the $20 we spent. She acknowledged they've had problems with it but thought it was fixed. She went to talk to her manager and said there's nothing they will do.\n\nSo $20 wasted on photos that are absolutely useless. Fun place, very rustic. VIP seats are expensive, and we were initially given a table with restricted views so we could only see half the arena. We had to move to the arena seats for the first part of the show to be able to see properly. We were then offered another table with a better view as a party did not show. Food was good BBQ buffet style, but got cold quickly. Would have been nice to have a sweet dessert like a bit of apple pie or a brownie to help justify the $65 charge.\nThey then over charged us by not deducting the full deposit we paid from the final bill. They did resolve this very quickly. We went for the Wednesday night bull riding. The service from the doorman to the DJ was top notch. We received great parking information, easy no-hassle entry, personal attention while buying swag, clean restrooms, quick bar service in multiple areas, DJ mix range was impressive as it spanned country to hip hop, new music to classics, the ring announcer kept the crowd engaged and introduced each rider and bull. What a really fun place to visit. Great country vibes and even a house band 5 nights a week. Food was decent and the service ...\nCategory: honky tonk"

        "Cherie and Steve run a fun bar with live music and Karaoke \ud83c\udfa4 \ud83d\ude04\nThe bartender was very friendly too",
        "Not a huge neighborhood bar guy, but as far as they go, this is as good as any and much better than most.  Crowd and staff were welcoming.  Good pours on drinks and a decent selection.  The 80s band playing was pretty decent too.  Definitely would be back if i lived in the area.  May still make the trip off and on.",
        "So, we stopped in last night during karaoke. Sat down at the bar, waited a good 10mins, and never got service. The bartender was walking around behind the bar looking like she was trying to avoid us. So we got up and left. On our way out, a guy participating in the karaoke asked, \"you're not staying?\" And I told him, \"ya I'm not sure what the problem is, but we can't order a drink,\" and he replied, \"oh, I know what the problem is...it's been a problem all night actually, we can't get one either.\"\n\nIt was our very first time trying to visit, always wanted to stop in. But we won't try again: no point.",
        "The grill food was \"ok\" at best. Service was decent. Maybe they were a lil understaffed. IDK. Atmosphere was comfy. The band was mediocre and karaoke, in The back, awful. As a smoker... I didn't even wanna be out there"

      "embedding_text": "Name: Roosters Country\nDescription: Casual, red-hued venue offerings beers, cocktails, live country music, karaoke & pool tables.\nReviews: I went here for my first time today and it happened to be the 11 year anniversary. I can see why this place has been around for so long because it was real nice and so were the people. Good music also. Will be sure to visit again! Cherie and Steve run a fun bar with live music and Karaoke \ud83c\udfa4 \ud83d\ude04\nThe bartender was very friendly too Not a huge neighborhood bar guy, but as far as they go, this is as good as any and much better than most.  Crowd and staff were welcoming.  Good pours on drinks and a decent selection.  The 80s band playing was pretty decent too.  Definitely would be back if i lived in the area.  May still make the trip off and on. So, we stopped in last night during karaoke. Sat down at the bar, waited a good 10mins, and never got service. The bartender was walking around behind the bar looking like she was trying to avoid us. So we got up and left. On our way out, a guy participating in the karaoke asked, \"you're not staying?\" And I told him, \"ya I'm not sure what the problem is, but we can't order a drink,\" and he replied, \"oh, I know what the problem is...it's been a problem all night actually, we can't get one either.\"\n\nIt was our very first time trying to visit, always wanted to stop in. But we won't try again: no point. The grill food was \"ok\" at best. Service was decent. Maybe they were a lil understaffed. IDK. Atmosphere was comfy. The band was mediocre and karaoke, in The back, awful. As a smoker... I didn't even wanna be out there\nCategory: honky tonk"
