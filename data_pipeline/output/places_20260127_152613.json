        "HUGE place lots to do. I came for a company work event so I'm not sure what all is included in the event fee. The catering for our event was phenomenal service and food in our private area was top tier. The bull riding event was so fun the riders were entertaining and they had a dog with a little bull rider costume at the beginning and was adorable.\n\nThe general public area as mentioned earlier is non stop there is different areas one with pool tables another with claw machines and other arcade games. The hoise band stage is located in the middle with a dancefloor in front. Multiple bars located all around. Food also available. There is an outdoor smoking patio and also the restrooms are super clean for how much goot traffic comes through. Also a gift shop with any tourist memories you may need.\n\nTruly a world landmark!!",
        "Went for a concert. Go early if you are general admission because it fills up! Dress light because it also gets warm. Cocktails were hit or miss depending on what bar you went to. I liked the ones better when you first walk in. The drinks were stronger. Bathrooms definitely need care by the end of the concert.",
        "Big space but the concert area & stages are set up weird!  Pool tables are $2 a game so a bit overpriced but I guess thats everything these days!  Bull riding in back is fun to watch but a bit short as they only have u in there in segments of 4 riders..... Overall a good time! But pricey as hell other than the cheap tickets to get u in the door",
        "Sold out was insane, shaboozey was great but it was way to packed, everyone was shoulder to shoulder. A poor guy passed out near us. There was lack of security front stage and multiple fights broke out. We left early sadly. Week days are calm dance lessons are great, food is good. I hope in the future they get better air cooling for packed concerts.",
        "We went to see Charles Wesley Godwin and it was amazing. Acoustics were great. The house band did an amazing job warming up the crowd and creating a good dancing atmosphere. This was a filun night. I ate the brisket loaded tater tots and was impressed. Fun date night for sure!"

        "Disappointed. $5 Miller Light Bottle. Can\u2019t figure out why these places don\u2019t take better care of the locals. Thought maybe I found my local bar. But $5 for Miller Light in a Dive Bar. I could have bought a 6 pack. I live across the street. Looking for a hangout to watch my teams. Plus TVs way way too high. Crink in the neck. Won\u2019t return. Take care of me and I\u2019ll take better care of you",
        "I did a Google search for San Antonio bars with live country music and El Honky Tonk came up.\nIt's a neighborhood bar just a little off the tourist traffic areas.\nSo glad I went - got there around 2:00 and stayed till closing time.\nPatrons were great, music was perfect AND the bartender was amazing - she was super friendly and super efficient & professional!\nI so enjoy watching a bartender work a busy bar - multi-tasking, networking, and the ability to continually smile & laugh.\nHigh recommended this watering hole ... the beer is COLD.",
        "I came after work to grab a beer, the bar was empty and I sat by myself waiting for 5 minutes while the bartender stood there on his phone. He finally came up to ask what I want to drink. Served my drink then went back on his phone. There\u2019s nba and football tonight and the tvs were turned off. The bar was empty and I didn\u2019t get welcomed. By far worst customer service, I\u2019ll stick to bar321.",

I was there 730p-10p on a Wed. But music started 8pm with multiple bands thru out the night.  I wanted to stay longer but had an early morning.   thoroughly enjoyed the music and the people dancing at this little gem.",
        "Visiting The White Horse in Austin was such an incredible experience and easily one of the highlights of my trip. This spot truly captures the heart and soul of Texas nightlife. From the moment I walked in, the energy was contagious \u2014 a mix of locals and visitors all coming together to enjoy a good time. The atmosphere is effortlessly cool, laid-back yet full of life, making it the perfect place to spend a night out.\n\nThe live country music is without a doubt the star of the show. The bands that play here are phenomenal, delivering authentic sounds that make you want to hit the dance floor immediately. Whether you\u2019re an experienced two-stepper or just watching from the sidelines, it\u2019s impossible not to get swept up in the rhythm and vibe of the crowd.\n\nOn top of the music, the drinks were excellent. The bartenders know how to mix strong, tasty cocktails, and the beer selection is spot on for a night of dancing and hanging out. Prices are very reasonable too, which only adds to the charm.\n\nOverall, The White Horse is more than just a bar \u2014 it\u2019s an experience. Great music, great drinks, and an atmosphere that\u2019s truly Austin. I can\u2019t wait to go back.",
        "100% fun. We were visiting Austin for the first time and so glad we went. It was a Sunday night and this joint was hopping. I can\u2019t remember the name of the house band but they were fantastic! It was quite the spectacle to see everyone two-stepping! It felt like a welcoming space\u2014everyone was friendly and there to have a good time. It ain\u2019t fancy, it was perfect!",
        "One of the first places I ever went in Austin and still get chills every time I walk in.  Hickoids and Beaumonts are the best at the white horse!  I'm from Texas she can tell by the way I'm two steppin round the room...",
        "Cute spot, the band was really good, the tacos outside are really yummy- I got the Al pastor (no onions) and veggie mushroom and potatoes.  They were a good size and tasty.  I would come back here with a group. It was nice that they had free entry before 7:30, but no re-entry after that time without paying cover charge."

        "As an out-of-towner with a soft spot for dive bars, Deep Ellum seemed like the place to land. But on a Saturday night in December, the streets felt weirdly quiet. Maybe it was the cold, maybe the party packed up and split town. Hard to say. What\u2019s left feels like a jumble of big-box bars and shiny spots trying way too hard.\n\nThen there\u2019s Adair's Saloon, sticking out like a scar you\u2019re proud of. Total holdout. No gloss, no BS\u2014just grit and soul while the rest of the block sells out. Old school juke box, black marker graffiti everywhere. Tags on the walls, scribbles on the tables, names, dates, half-drunk philosophies scrawled by people who came before.\n\nCold beers that don\u2019t mess around, greasy burgers that soak up your bad decisions, and live music that couldn\u2019t care less if you\u2019re cool, rich, or Instagram-famous. Adair\u2019s feels real in a neighborhood that\u2019s mostly cosplay now. If Deep Ellum\u2019s glory days are fading, this joint\u2019s still flying the torn flag loud and proud.",
        "Adair's Saloon has been a Dallas staple for decades.  It's second incarnation is the current location at 2624 Commerce in Deep Ellum.\n\nThe humble saloon has been a live music Mecca for many listeners.  The Red-Dirt/Texas Music scene has always been strong at Adair's.  Live music nightly are rarely is there a cover charge.  A great time with good bartenders and friendly patrons.\n\nThe kitchen is always ready to provide some sustainance whether the famous Adair's Cheeseburger and Fries or one of the \"newer\" items on the menu.\n\nTake a look at the schedule and pick a night to go hear some live music.  It is a good time at Adair's Saloon.",
        "Best burger in deep ellum. Yea i said it. This is also the oldest existing bar in deep ellum, so show respect when you're here, you're in a museum of dallas culture. And in dang good company. Transport yourself to a time forgotten of big city livin' without all the \"bottleservice\" lifestyle shenanigans, tip well, put a song on the jukebox and buy a pack of cigs from the vintage cigarette machine. You are your own cowboi.",

Courteous, attentive,  and joyful. Simply adore Adair's!!\nBest parking, in the rear! Ifkyk.\nP.s. Special 9.99 burger and fries on Sundays!!!",
        "Delicious food and amazing burgers. I\u2019ve been twice before. I came with sister in law who is 18. They refused us service cuz she was 18 even though we didn\u2019t plan on drinking just eating. They looked like they needed the service. There wasn\u2019t a soul in there. We were excited to eat there too."

The demonstrating dancers were skilled and agile and looked like they enjoyed what they were doing. They provided a safe environment for everybody involved, even on a packed dance floor. It did get very loud and crowded around 9:30pm, but they catered the music to the attendees. 10/10 would come again.",

We even got to see a group of kids and parents learn to line dance. I highly recommend the hot chicken sandwich with tater tots and the house Nashville Hard Cider.",

Plenty of tables and bars inside. They get overly crowded at night. Drinks were good, but priced high. Bartenders were attentive.",

Unreal.\nThis man has Italian roots and it shows, he could teach a masterclass in hospitality. He had drinks sorted before we even realised we needed them.

Tesla Dawn and the Butterfly Effect was on, and they were OUTSTANDING! We got a couple of drinks there which were well made, and the decor was very neat with lots of things to look at on the walls. My only complaint is the space; because it's the longest bar, the whole place is long and skinny making it crammed when listening to the band. Nevertheless, this was the best stop for music we found.",

When I walked in they were playing a Backstreet Boys cover and several people were doing the electric slide.\n\nI sat down at the bar and ordered a Red Bull and the 3 crispy beef tacos. The tacos were good, but not great, but I don\u2019t think people come here for the food. They would have been better without the addition of the avocado cream sauce, which kind of overpowered the flavor of the otherwise simple beef taco.\n\nIt was a fun spot and I would come here again!",

If you\u2019re looking for a lively night out in Asheville, this is the place to be. The drinks were great, the staff was friendly, and the overall vibe made for a memorable experience.\n\nThat said, just a heads-up: it gets really loud inside. If you\u2019re hoping for a quiet conversation, this might not be the best setting. But if you\u2019re down for dancing, socializing, and soaking up the party atmosphere, the volume just adds to the fun.\n\nAll in all, Nursing Asheville knows how to bring the good times.

        "We went into Nudies Honky Tonk on a week night. Very slow venue compared to others on Broadway.\nDrinks were cheaper than most but probably the worst Old Fashioned I've ever had. They do have a bottle of Louis XIII behind the bar if your wallet can take the hit.\nDefinitely could feel the history with the memorabilia on the walls and had an epic bar top with silver coins.\nThere wasn't much of anything going on so we had 1 drink and went to the next bar.\nQuick service and probably much different on a weekend for atmosphere."

        "Giving it a 3 only because of the vibe.  Granted we were there on a Monday (Broadway was still packed!) so it wasn't too crowded inside. Our waitress was great - friendly, helpful with menu items, etc.  We went up on the roof, which is a wonderful view, and the most crowded area, and then went back down to the 1st floor to eat and have drinks. The live band was good but I didn't see a lot of happy, smiling folks and the place had just generally low energy - so unlike Garth!",
        "We truly enjoyed our visit at Friends in Low Places. We went up to the Tiki Bar where there was great live music. We ordered the Chicken Tender Tower that came with fries and enough to feed the 4 of us. The fries were both traditional fries and steak fries that had the \u2018trixie\u2019 dust coating and were quite tasty. The chicken was cooked to perfection.  Overall, we loved this bar and one can definitely see the effort that Garth and Trisha put into the creation of such a great place to enjoy on Broadway.",
        "My family and I visited Friends in Low Places Bar & Honky-Tonk for lunch to celebrate my son\u2019s 21st birthday. From the moment we arrived, the host stationed outside the restaurant was exceptionally friendly and accommodating. He offered us the choice of seating in front of the band or on the second floor overlooking the stage, and we were seated promptly.\n\nShortly after, our server, Conrad, greeted us and provided outstanding service throughout the meal. He was attentive, professional, and went out of his way to make my son feel celebrated by displaying his birthday on the screen and generously providing a complimentary chocolate dessert. His thoughtful gestures truly made the experience memorable for our family.\n\nDuring our visit, I was disappointed to learn that, with only a few exceptions, many Nashville restaurants bearing the names of well-known music artists have limited direct involvement from those artists. Most are owned and operated by hospitality companies that license the artists\u2019 names, which was unexpected.\n\nWe were pleased to learn that Garth Brooks is genuinely involved in Friends in Low Places Bar & Honky-Tonk, which made the experience even more meaningful.",
        "Really, I would\u2019ve given them only 4 stars, but my server at the bar cordially and swiftly refilled my elbow-spilt cocktail, without a wince. Probably figured because I was an old guy, he\u2019d cut me a break, especially paying for another $14+dollar drink during the happy hours of the afternoon . . . on a Thursday.\n\nWe sat for almost one round and the band finally came in very hard. A good rockin\u2019 cover band with fiddle blasted away at several hits and finally played Charlie Daniel\u2019s Band, \u201cThe Devil Went Down to Georgia\u201d. About that time we were finishing our second round, and decided to start bar hoppin\u2019 since I had seen the CDB live five times.\n\nVery good sound at our position to the stage, with big flat screens everywhere. A great place to see a show. They even give souvenir plastic drink cups with the FinLP logo.\n\nThis is definitely one of the better bars we stopped in and actually hung out for a bit.\n\nDon\u2019t forget the gift store on the way out. Yikes!\n\nCritDicks",

        "Best Times are before 3:30 in the Afternoon. Crowds are at a minimum and Bearable. After 4 is When Traffic picks up,(especially on concert nights...so plan ahead), and the entertainment really gets to Moving. Most places are Cover Free, but I.D. check is Mandatory( so please keep it available for the rooftops. Highly recommend to Visit For at the Least...the entertainment and Experience.Dont Forget Your Boots and Hats. Check ahead for Weather updates, And Enjoy",
        "I love seeing the signs and discovering all of the different country music bars. It gets very crowded on weekend nights. The drinks are not very good so don\u2019t expect quality in that area. But, what they lack in yummy cocktails they make up for in live music and dancing! You can find more than his country music also. Those bars have rooftops and several floors in between. Try them out and see which ones you like best.",
        "I\u2019d argue you haven\u2019t truly experienced Nashville if you skip this area. It\u2019s packed with bars offering live music (of course) and plenty of great food. If you\u2019re a woman traveling solo, consider taking an Uber or Lyft back to your hotel instead of walking late at night.",
        "Honky Tonk Highway in Nashville is absolutely insane in the best way possible!\nIt is pure chaos day and night. During the day, it\u2019s nonstop live music, bachelor and bachlorette parties everywhere, and people dancing in the streets before noon. The energy is wild and contagious with every bar blasting music and serving drinks like there's no tomorrow.\n\nWhen the night comes, it turns into total madness. Neon lights, packed rooftops, bands on every floor, and mass crowds wearing hats, boots and very little clothing everywhere you look. This is the place to go to party like a Rockstar! Traffic is an absolute nightmare so plan on staying out until after 3am whether you choose to or not. Definitely something to experience!"

        "Very cool placeIt didn't happen to be particularly busy.The friday night that I went, but the dance lessons were a lot of fun.And the dance floor was wide open for any time.We wanted to dance",
        "Being the only country dance hall in the area, this place has a lot of potential to grow if they wanted to.\n\nVery traditional/old style of place. When there's a DJ, he plays almost an hour straight of slow country songs that couples are dancing to. Then he'll play maybe 2 line dances or hip hop songs, then go back to the almost hour of slow country.. and repeat. Pretty boring for someone who is there by themselves to join group line dances.\n\nEven when a bunch of people get on the floor for a fun, modern line dance, he still only plays a couple of them. He should mix them evenly....a few slow country songs then a few popular line dancing songs, etc.\n\nOlder crowd (50+). No website. No cover when a DJ is playing. Half price cover before 8pm. (check their FB for info).\n\nOld bar system where the bartender keeps your card... Which wastes time when you want to close out and she has to look through a large stack of cards to find yours.\n\nFood is simple, but good. Really yummy pizzas and friendly staff.",

It is rich in atmosphere and a Texas-type of coziness.  We went for the main show on a Saturday night and it was PACKED!  Loved the place as a venue, and also for the music acts they had.  The early musicians were just as good as the main show.  I had a blast!  I wish there was more seating around the edge of the main room becuase that filled up fast!  If you're the type that likes to dance, then you've got plenty of space for that till the crowd starts pushing you forward to the stage.",
        "Visiting town it was on a Tuesday around 1pm. I wasn't expecting live music. But Sammi Rae and Henry Williams were playing. Really good too. Fun place. Bar in front then the music hall towards the back. I'm not sure if this was just going on for the holidays or if they have free live music during the day all the time. Definitely worth checking out. They have a ton of autographed pictures on the walls of many of the artists who've played there at the ticketed nightly concerts which I hear are mostly standing room only.  Lot of big names and a ton of history.",

My son had the privilege of performing here a few days ago. He and his band traveled from Nashville, TN, and are already looking to book it again! Playing Gruene Hall is quite an honor for a country music artist and most of them will say The Gruene is one of those infamous stages like the Grand Ole Opry that performers will have on their proverbial \u2018Bucket List\u2019 of dream stages. Watching an up and comer such as Jared Hovis play traditional country music at Gruene Hall is a sight to behold. He was honored to be there, and the tears welled up in his humble green eyes were testament to his true respect for the opportunity to sing at the Gruene!"

From the moment you step inside, the low lighting and neon signs glowing across the walls scream \u201cTexas\u201d in the most nostalgic way. This isn\u2019t a polished, modern bar\u2014it\u2019s a dive with soul, where the spirit of old Austin thrives.\n\nThe ambiance is unmatched, with weathered wooden floors and a cozy, slightly cluttered charm that feels like a friend\u2019s living room\u2014if that friend loved live music and cold beer. Speaking of beer, Donn\u2019s serves it ice-cold, the kind of frosty that hits just right on a warm Texas night. The unmistakable aroma of freshly popped popcorn wafts through the air, a simple touch that evokes memories of my first honky tonk experience here and adds to the bar\u2019s warm, welcoming vibe.\n\nLive music is the heartbeat of Donn\u2019s Depot, with local country and blues acts taking the stage most nights. The dance floor, often packed with two-steppers of all ages, is a testament to the bar\u2019s enduring appeal. The staff is friendly, the drinks are affordable, and the crowd is a mix of regulars and curious newcomers, all drawn to the unpretentious charm.\n\nDonn\u2019s isn\u2019t trying to be anything it\u2019s not\u2014with Christmas lights up all year round, it\u2019s a time capsule, a place where Austin\u2019s musical heritage lives on. For anyone craving a genuine honky tonk experience, Donn\u2019s Depot is a must-visit. Just grab a cold one, snag some popcorn, and let the neon-lit nights sweep you away.",

Our bartender Kellie not only took great care of us there, but we ran into her a couple days later when I complimented her Broken Spoke hat then realized it was our bartender!!  Gotta love it, will be back and would recommend, ask for Kellie!",

The atmosphere was lively but still relaxed\u2014exactly what you\u2019d hope for in a classic Stockyards saloon.\n\nIt\u2019s not flashy or overdone, just a fun, welcoming place with great energy. If you\u2019re exploring the area or showing friends around town, it\u2019s definitely worth popping in for the experience.\n\nOverall, a great little saloon with lots of character!",
        "We had one Hell of a time !  The Band was spot on and the crowd couldn\u2019t have been any friendlier. Cold beer and great service topped it off. Older crowd which we really enjoyed, everyone was having a Big Ball in Cowtown",
        "We had some fun and our waitress was nice but the drinks are truly horrendous. Pictured is my \u201ccrown soda\u201d next to a bottle of water lol. Again it was a fun time, I did enjoy myself but these bartenders could do a lot better for paying customers",
        "This is a great bar with an awesome Texas atmosphere but the one star is for the lady at the entrance. She is running a sham. We accidentally walked in because of the awesome bar stools they have while crossing the street. We had probably spent 30 seconds in the bar and the lady at the entrance asked another customer to reach out to us and make our way to the entrance. Without asking or giving us the option if we wanted to stay or not she made us pay for the $5 cover charge stating that if you just walk into the door after 7 pm you have to pay, even without us ordering or staying a minute at the place. Seriously, is this how you want to run a business and charge people? Have the courtesy and at least offer them a chance if they want to stay or not.\nWe ordered margaritas and it was basically just lemonade.\nI'd say terrific ambience, terrible service and people working here.\nSkip if you can.",
        "Went on Nov.22nd and opened a tab and when I closed it I asked to see the charges. She said she closed it and couldn\u2019t print out the charges. A manager RELUCTANTLY printed out the charges and was adamant that she needed that printout back. I paid and tipped in cash. The receipt said $109.55 and they took $189.55 out of my bank account. I have left a message and no return call yet. I do have a my customer receipt that shows $109.55.\nI will not return even though it was a fun place.\n\nUPDATE: thank you for the quick response. We did enjoy the establishment and hopefully when we return it will be without issue."

The service can be a bit spotty, but it\u2019s definitely worth checking out!\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of interesting decorations and contributions from visitors. It\u2019s a simple bar with your typical bar selections, but the historical aspect of it sets it apart. The drinks are priced pretty normally. I recommend stopping in for a round and to check out the inside!",
        "White Elephant Saloon | Boots, Burgers & Bourbon-Scented Elbows \ud83e\udd20\ud83c\udf54\n\nI love the White Elephant\u2014it\u2019s like stepping into the wild, whiskey-soaked heart of Fort Worth. The vibe? Pure honky-tonk magic. The bar? Cozy\u2026 and by cozy, I mean prepare to get friendly with the person next to you, because this place is tight. And I don\u2019t mean in a bad way\u2014just... elbows will touch, and that\u2019s part of the charm.\n\nTechnically, the food comes from Love Shack next door, and y\u2019all\u2014it\u2019s a burger party in your mouth. Juicy, messy, flavor bomb central. Just know that ordering can feel a little \u201cwait\u2026 do I go over there or...?\u201d but once it lands on your table, none of that matters.\n\nDrinks? Strong, cold, and consistent. The bartenders don\u2019t play around.\n\nAll in all, White Elephant is the kind of place where you come for a drink and end up two-stepping, bonding with strangers, and contemplating naming your next pet \u201cBrisket.\u201d Highly recommend if you love a little grit with your good time.",

        "Great place with some amazing history! Live music was very good and the bar staff were fantastic!",
        "I feel like the Stockyards are losing their authenticity. Brought a friend from London, the music playing was just typical rock and when the band came on at 8:00 it was very folksy, no dancing, it just didn't fit the vibe. He asked why he wasn't hearing very much country music in the whole area lol. I don't go as often as I used to when I was growing up, but I feel like the whole area is changing. But the service was good and we enjoyed our time overall."

It\u2019s a cool venue but I wasn\u2019t happy with the atmosphere to be honest, no one was respectful to those giving their acceptance speech on stage, everyone was drinking and being stupid and just loud and having a good old time, but had no respect for those that were there to accept their awards. It was really hard to hear them speak on the stage. I feel like the microphone could\u2019ve been a little louder, but yeah, I just wasn\u2019t happy. It was not a very professional atmosphere. It was having the awards in a bar like that to me not cool. It was much better when they had the actual awards at Billie Bob\u2019s because people were all sitting and they were listening like it was very professional award show. I wasn\u2019t happy with the atmosphere at rhinestone saloon for an award show. It\u2019s too small. It was too crowded. Too loud bad idea.",

I loved the stools along the dance floor for watching the dancers. Great mix of music with lots of line dancing throughout. There's also billiards and a smoking room. I'll return next time I'm in OKC.",
        "I walked in at the tail end of a line dance class so learned it. Have never seen a class offered so late. I guess too much going on in OK City for a crowd there so didn't get to dance except for a line dance. Nice dance floor, friendly staff, good bartenders and DJ. Lots of room to move about and do different things.",
        "Amazing venue, it has a ton of potential. Great bartenders and security. Terrible DJ and culture. DJ couldn\u2019t pick a BPM range, genre nor the correct tempo to a song. At points he\u2019d mix songs every 30 seconds. Even overheard the security guards complaining about it. Awesome place for two stepping and swing, don\u2019t get me wrong, but line dancing seemed to have only been 2 songs every hour on a Friday night. You could tell the line dancing tourist from out of town were upset and left early in the night.\n\nNothing against the instructors, amazing people when I talked to them. The lessons took way too long to teach, after two hours we were already ready to leave. As a tip for the two step instructor, try to learn common moves and terms to explain what you\u2019re doing. Not do \u201cthis\u201d or do \u201cthat\u201d",
        "Went here for the 1st time the other night with some girl friends for a birthday party. The cover was free before 10pm, parking was 10. Drinks were about 8-9. The line dancing happened pretty quick so I kept missing my chance to get out there every time. The atmosphere felt safe and everyone got along inside. Would like to go back again sometime! I like the bi-level bar idea and lots of seating! Security was nice! Lots of cops around outside tho so if u don't like that idea stay away! And all over at closing time downtown.",

We did go there and see the place which it was nice and very Ranchy with fun sounds coming from the inside. I just won\u2019t pay cover to get into a club so if the main attraction is not there I don\u2019t want to pay. We actually asked some locals where to go after Goo Goo Dolls and they said to go to Cowboys OKC. I wish the riders were there but I will try again when I am back.",

Yes, on Friday nights there can be \u2018less\u2019 country 2 stepping but it\u2019s still a solid 1/3 of the songs. Thursday and Saturday are typically more country and Friday can have hip hop mixed in too for the younger crowd- in my experience over 16 years.\n\nFriday and Saturdays LIVE bull riding is always amazing and my favorite, as an equestrian and farm woman myself.\n\nThe Mechanical Bull here IS WAY BETTER THAN REDNECKS.\n\nAs an actual rider, this bull is a 40,000$+++++ professional training mechanical bull that REAL bull riders train on.\n\nRednecks\u2019s is weird and doesn\u2019t even do the proper motion at all.\n\n\u201cTraining\u201d on the mechanical bull here and watching the riders is my favorite- but I also love the entire staff and the perfect blend of 2 stepping, line dances, and some classic 90s hip hop on Fridays.\n\nThe bar tenders are all kind and excellent at their job, the bouncers are great and the management is great. They do an amazing job at catering to all generations and I always go alone, and make friends and dance with strangers every time.\n\nIt\u2019s the most inclusive club to go to solo or with a group or for date night. Upstairs is chill, with pool tables everywhere. A TON of bathrooms both upstairs, and downstairs. You\u2019ll never have to wait in a line or have no toilet paper.\n\nBar tenders prepare multiple water cups and leave them out on the bar to grab and the water IS FILTERED \ud83d\udca5 not tap.\n\n11/10 this is the spot to spend your weekends."

The waitress was upfront about the long wait, but it got worse. They only had \"canned soda,\" but when she brought it to me it was poured in a glass and very flat. It seemed more like it was poured from a 2-liter that had been sitting open. I ordered 18 wings. After waiting two hours, she brought the food but it was \"boneless wings.\" She said the kitchen ran out of the \"good wings.\" Unfortunately, these weren't even boneless wings. they were tenderloin strips that had been cut into small bitesize chicken poppers. I paid for 18 wings and I got one bit chicken nuggets. Lastly, the music was too loud and the musician felt the need to do a guitar solo on every song.",

        "Recommended by Dayton dancers, Nashville Palace turned out to be a surprisingly fun stop on our trip! We\u2019re used to dance venues playing unfamiliar music when we travel, but on Thursday this DJ nailed it\u2014his playlist included many of the same pop, hip hop, and country songs we dance to in Dayton and Columbus, Ohio. He rotated three line dances with three country swing songs, which kept things lively, though I wish he\u2019d leaned more into line dancing like we do back home.\nWhile country swing dominated the partner dancing, we managed to sneak in some West Coast Swing, East Coast Swing, and Cha Cha\u2014though not consistently. It was surprising that country swing was the only partner style featured. Sure, it\u2019s flashy and fun, but it lacks structure\u2014no step count, no shared rhythm. West Coast and Cha Cha are just as sexy, but they\u2019re actual dances. It left me wondering: why not teach other partner styles like West Coast Swing, Waltz, Country Two Step, or Night Club Two Step?\nFloor etiquette was another issue. Country swing dancers took up a lot of space and didn\u2019t seem aware of others trying to Two Step around the edge. At one point, a \u201ccountry swing hijack\u201d happened\u2014where dancers jumped in mid-song\u2014and while it was entertaining to watch, it sidelined a lot of us who just wanted to dance.\nThe line dance instructor did a great job teaching a beginner-friendly routine, but be warned: this isn\u2019t the place for casual dancers who only know the Electric Slide or Cupid Shuffle. Most of the line dancers were experienced, and you won\u2019t be able to pick up routines on the fly.\nOn the plus side, seating was decent with bar stools lining the dance floor, and the music was loud enough to energize the room without being overwhelming.",

Nikki was our amazing event coordinator - she handled every detail like a PRO!  From food ordering, to vendor table set up, raffle tickets for door prizes, DJ & Line Dance Instructor, and MORE!  Our bartenders handled our 400+ guests that night and even created 2 signature cocktails for us.  Stephanie, Calista, Eric, Allie, all great! It was a BLAST!!  Everyone LOVED IT!"

        "Great place for line dancing and drinking. However, security guards are on a power trip. That will throw you out for no reason. Based off false accusations. And then when you try to get to the bottom of while you're being kicked out, they start yelling at you and putting hands on you would not recommend unless you just like getting thrown out of places for no reason at all. I was outside in the smoking section minding my business by myself and got thrown out for touching somebody. Please explain to me how the hell you touched somebody when you're sitting by yourself.",
        "You can\u2019t beat having a good time and meeting new people. When dancing is involved. To find prime parking and seating it\u2019s best to go before 7:00pm (when they open) because the lines can get long. And for the young people (under 21) don\u2019t think you won\u2019t get caught for underage drinking. Trust me when I say they have secret workers around they do. And the owners have a well oiled relationship with Lebanon police department. They will not risk their license because you wanna be slick. Do your dirt off property. Other than that have fun",
        "Absolutely love it here. 3rd time coming and i got to come for Turkey Bowling. Made it to the Top 2. Had a lot of fun. Music was awesome, drinks were good, plenty of Dancing, they could really mix in a few more slow dances into the mix but great nonetheless.",

The instructors are patient and full of energy, and they make learning new moves fun and easy. Drinks are cold and well-made, and the staff is friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is upbeat but comfortable, so you can dance the night away or just enjoy watching. Definitely one of my favorite spots in town for a fun night out",

        "Great good when the right cook is there! Jerry Prince is a Master in the kitchen! Great atmosphere. Scottie is the best teacher for dance lessons. He and his wife are very talented and work well together. Sometimes the patrons can get out of hand, yet Sherita runs a tight ship. The security guys are friendly, helpful and firm. Zero tolerance for weapons and drugs. Safe place for children when line dance lessons are given. Non smoking and all the lights on for these events. When you come regularly, you become family. If youre going to \"close the place down\" and stay until they close at 3am, be courteous and leave when asked. They have families too. Overall, I would visit this place every chance I get.... and I do",

The band was fun and engaging.\n\nWent back a few days later, more crowded due to the weekend obviously. Had a great time then too.\n\nStaff is friendly and service was pretty fast. They have a great whiskey selection with quite a few allocated bottles. Normal beer and everything else if you want also.\n\nStop in and have a cold one.",

As an old heavy metal junkie I walk in and hear the band Ballistic and they play all the great 70, 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s hard rock that only a metal head can truly appreciate. Great service, great music. Thank you !!! I\u2019m sure they have other great music genre\u2019s play there also. But Ballistic made my day!",

        "The entry fee was $15. One beer was $9. The don't sell bottles, only cans.\n\nI visited the PBR Cowboy Bar on Fourth Street in Louisville yesterday and had a great time. The place has an energy that pulls you in as soon as you walk through the door. The atmosphere feels lively and welcoming, and it is the kind of bar where you can easily relax, enjoy a drink, and chat with people around you. The crowd was one of the highlights for me because everyone seemed friendly and ready to have a good time. It gave the whole night a fun and easygoing vibe.\n\nThe setup of the bar is also really cool. The cowboy influenced theme is done in a way that feels authentic without being over the top. The staff works hard and keeps the place running smoothly, and I never had to wait long for anything. You can tell they know how to create an enjoyable experience for visitors.\n\nThe only thing that I think could be improved is the music. I really enjoy country music but what was playing last night felt a bit strange. It was hard to dance to and the lyrics were very difficult to understand. I think the audio quality could be improved, which would make the music fit the atmosphere much better. Other than that, everything about my visit was excellent. I would definitely come back and I can recommend it to anyone who wants a fun night out in Louisville.",
        "Well...all the tables in this joint are \" reserved\".  When I inquired when they may be opened up, the bartender said that they were \" reserved for bottle service only\".  That puzzled me so I asked, how much is bottle service and was promptly told, \" I dont have that info\"...you gotta be kidding me!\n\nAnywho....bar has no seating and very limited outside seating.  This is sad...the live band is playing to two bartenders and and in guy standing at the bar, because every seat is \" reserved\".\n\nLets do math...reserved couch seats 10 folks and any good bar should turn that over at 35.00 per seat.  They way I see it tonight....you must be raking it in on the weekend.  8 seperate seating areas empty....minus 10 guests at 35.00 each...wow..2800.00/hr on low end for DT Louisville...im sure my numbers are weak on per seat average, but was giving it a fair chance.",
        "Cool place! Drinks were good, service was great, and they even have a bull you can ride. If you\u2019re in downtown Louisville and tolerate country music, check it out!",
        "Extremely disappointed with the way this was handled. I lost my wallet and went back to ask if anyone had turned it in, and the staff was completely unhelpful. They clearly don\u2019t take lost items seriously.\nThe manager was especially rude when I asked for help\u2014she didn\u2019t seem to care at all and wouldn\u2019t even bother to look around or check properly. The lack of basic customer service and empathy was shocking. I would not recommend this place based on how they treat people in situations like this.",
        "This is one of the best bars in Louisville for nightlife.  Located right in 4th Street Live, this bar's cowboy themed bar provides a terrific atmosphere for those that like music, dancing, and/or riding a mechanical bull.\n\nThe drink prices are about what you'd expect at a place like this.\n\nThe security and staff are quite prevalent so it's probably not best to get too far out of line, despite it being such a hype and rambunctious environment.\n\nThere are a few stairs that you can go up and  there are spots to sit down in chairs in more of a lounge type setting.\n\nAnother cool part of this place is that they are open until 3am on weekends. Definitely a good place to go when all of the other bars are closed.\n\nOverall, this bar is definitely worth checking out if you are looking for good nightlife."

Water. Really loitering begged to come back we sing awesome and been trying to bring in more business then EMPTY TABLES but hey discrimination against medical and then decided to seem to make it known still watching the behavior medically not supposed to drink not my fault people buy them anyway for me doesn't mean I drink it\nThe bartender went and removed our songs from the dj list because we refuse to pay for water and only come out to relax with no alcohol also not driving under the influence and left high and dry from life\nWaiting for the cops to arrive for loitering when I have been here every weekend and HAVE SPENT $ HERE WHEN THE WOMEN WERE WORKING AND MY BROTHER WAS WITH US actually spent a lot that night.

This is my first time at a bar where the charge you for a cup of water so I said nevermind without arguing. Then the next thing I knew the DJ came up to me saying I was knock off the list because the bartender/ manager said to. This is not right at all and I'm very upset with this. My sister medically can not drink either the stress is killing her so her medical doctors told us to do this and we have a medical card that covers it and this is discrimination the bartender wants to state loitering this is wrong we have actually tried to bring in tons more business nobody even heard of this place and people LOVE OUR SINGING WE JUST SANG BON JOVI",

        "Ordered the brisket dip to go, which had a huge chunk of super hard dried out inedible meat, even when attempting to soak in the au jus.  Expensive sandwich with the low quality meat I had to throw away.  I should have known upon walking into a bbq place that had zero aroma of any smoked meats.  Shoestring fries were good, but won't bother returning to try anything else.",
        "Walked here from our hotel with some coworkers while in town. The drinks were good and both the bartenders were really fun and friendly. The food was good, could have used a little salt for our preference. The buffalo dip (not pictured) was a big hit with the table. We were there on karaoke night which we enjoyed hearing people\u2019s performances, just chilling and chatting.",
        "Morgan was an amazing bartender and made my experience so enjoyable! She was super friendly and welcoming. Morgan paid attention to every detail, made great drink recommendations, and mixed everything perfectly. She truly cares about making sure customers have a great time. I\u2019ll definitely be back, and I\u2019ll be asking for Morgan again!",
        "Ordered on door dash tonight pork was just the scraps. Mold on the bottom of the roll order the kettle chips and most of them were burnt. Green beans  and brisket were just ok  overall I am still hungry after paying over 100 for a family of 4.  The only thing that was good was the Mac n cheese. Also I got 3 extra boxes of loaded chips that I did not even order. Overall I will not be ordering this again"

        "Music was great. The waitresses were adorable. I'm 51 and down for a good time. I went on Saturday night around 10:00. I am pretty sure everyone else there was under 40. I love watching people have a good time. It was shoulder to shoulder crowded. I felt a little \"too old for this shit.\" and was mildly annoyed with myself for getting old.",
        "Does this look like a $13 sandwich to you? It was all bun. Also, the poor bartender was by herself at 5 pm on a Wednesday. We didn\u2019t take it out on here because it wasn\u2019t her fault but very disappointing. Lastly, this place charges almost 4% for using your credit card to pay. This is not posted on the menu nor the outside door. I checked before we left. If you\u2019re going to do that, post it.",
        "OMG fun place to spend Saturday night before Christmas eve.\n\nGreat food...tasty burger. Chicken breast salad.  Cowboy pasta.  Toasted ravs. Breaded mushrooms. All were very tasty and priced right.\n\nAnd live entertainment guitar player.  Really a neat  place.      Scotty our (new) waiter made our dinner even better. Smiling happy attentive accurate thorough. The best!\n\nGreat family setting on Main Street.  We will be back for sure.",
        "If I could give their service zero stars I would. Went on a night out with my friends, asked for a round of drinks (shots) for a group of five and the male bartender said straight to my face \u201cno\u201d. He only served us pre made shots. Maybe don\u2019t work at a bar? Also not to mention they weren\u2019t super busy.\nI typically leave fairly good reviews and like to look at the bright side of things and give (especially small business) the benefit of the doubt.\nThis experience was so rude and I will not be returning.",
        "Came for the live music but left after trying to order drinks and the bartender said she\u2019d throw me and my friends out simply for advocating for myself as she kept serving others even though I had been waiting nearly 10 mins. I politely pointed out to her she had skipped me several times and then she threatened to kick us out for that, so we made it easier and left. I\u2019d recommend not allowing your bartenders to drink so they can be most efficient and respectful to patrons while maintaining order within the establishment. It was also nearly shoulder to shoulder deep with people. Dangerously crowded."

It's a very intimate/homey sort of setting.  There's a little bit of room to dance and you're encouraged to do so.  It's a good little drive out of town though, so don't bring too much cash for the bar!",

They really do put alot effort since they only operate once a week and it shows!\n\nNo food (only drinks) and cash only. Sorta limiting but overall love it!

Horrible quality, clearly something is wrong with it. We showed the photos to our waitress and asked for a refund of the $20 we spent. She acknowledged they've had problems with it but thought it was fixed. She went to talk to her manager and said there's nothing they will do.\n\nSo $20 wasted on photos that are absolutely useless.",

We had to move to the arena seats for the first part of the show to be able to see properly. We were then offered another table with a better view as a party did not show. Food was good BBQ buffet style, but got cold quickly. Would have been nice to have a sweet dessert like a bit of apple pie or a brownie to help justify the $65 charge.\nThey then over charged us by not deducting the full deposit we paid from the final bill.

        "So, we stopped in last night during karaoke. Sat down at the bar, waited a good 10mins, and never got service. The bartender was walking around behind the bar looking like she was trying to avoid us. So we got up and left. On our way out, a guy participating in the karaoke asked, \"you're not staying?\" And I told him, \"ya I'm not sure what the problem is, but we can't order a drink,\" and he replied, \"oh, I know what the problem is...it's been a problem all night actually, we can't get one either.\"\n\nIt was our very first time trying to visit, always wanted to stop in. But we won't try again: no point.",
        "The grill food was \"ok\" at best. Service was decent. Maybe they were a lil understaffed. IDK. Atmosphere was comfy. The band was mediocre and karaoke, in The back, awful. As a smoker... I didn't even wanna be out there"
